With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
The casual, the idealistic,
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
These varied chapters in your hand,
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
The intellect's cold observation,
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
Unripe powers, or fading art,
Might have been turned to better ends -
The bitter record of the heart.
Of your sublime clear poetry.
I only wish the words I write
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Such as they are, view these extremes
Indifferent to the world's delight
Your spirit's true simplicity
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel. Prince Vyazemsky
Let us all follow his example!
All night, barely a foot away!
"Why the devil can't you die?"'
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
'My uncle, what a worthy man,
That sitting by the bed all day,
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Of cosseting one who's half alive;
Falling ill like that, and dying;
But, God, what tedium to sample
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
It summons up respect, one can
2.
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Meet my hero of romance,
There beside the Neva's shore,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
Such our young dog's meditation,
Here without an ounce of bother,
As his horses plough the dust,
Before you, let him now advance.
Though the North affects me so.
By the will of Zeus the Just.
There I too strolled to and fro:
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
Where you too were nourished or
3.
First Madame, you understand,
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
Taught him everything by whim,
Monsieur L'Abb�, French and thin,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
Then off to ramble in the park.
And died with all he owed unmet.
Then Monsieur taught the child
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
Always gave three balls a year
His father had a fine career
And gladly lived a life of debt
4.
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
Of restless youth's tumultuous passion,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
And my Eugene was free at last,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
Into society he rode.
Did all that was required to please.
What more is needed? All agreed
A London dandy safely classed
Now, when Eugene reached the age
5.
(Critics stern, acute as any)
As well-read, but opinionated,
Touching lightly on each theme,
God be thanked, some imitation,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
When talk was of some graver matter,
A bit of this a bit of that,
And we can all display �clat,
For conversation's art created.
With some ready epigram.
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
Then like a very sage could seem
We've all acquired some education
Onegin, he was deemed by many
6.
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Or end a letter with vale,
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
Of history all turned to rust,
Latin's not in fashion now,
From Romulus to our own day,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
In his memory tucked away.
As for finding ancient treasure
But kept the juiciest stories ever
To read an epigraph, and might
He'd no desire to dig the dust
He knew enough I would allow
7.
On what the state relies, he told,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
With staple products its supply,
Left his father, stunned by theory,
To give his life for poetry,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
To tell iambic from trochee.
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
The wealth of nations was his topic;
Deep in all things economic
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Despite all efforts, or aspire
He lacked the passion and desire
Of how it lives, the what and why
8.
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
Mastered I've no time to tell,
One thing alone he studied well,
Plus another hidden reason,
His labour, torment and delight,
His springtime occupation bright,
That occupied each night and day,
But as for genius, if any,
And kept dull boredom far away -
Far from Italy's allure.
And, exiled for that very thing
The science of the tender passion
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
9/10.
All attentive, or just mumble!
How utterly himself forgetting!
Glistening, an obedient tear!
How swift his letters from the heart!
How languid was his reticence,
How passionate his eloquence,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
From the first, he'd spread confusion,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
His glance now bold, with tender art,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
11.
Silently impart love's teaching!
And daze the eyes of innocence,
Of despair, burn flattery's incense,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Overcome with wit and passion,
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Secure a secret assignation,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
How skilfully he'd feign the new,
Await the touch, involuntary,
Listen for the heart's first cry,
Ingenuous naivety,
Or frighten with a glance or two
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
12.
How poisonous the words he used!
What traps he set for those abused!
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
Content forever with their life,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel,
As some suspicious aged devil,
The careful spouse as much his man,
Were ever dearest friends of his,
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
To his rivals, that whole set,
Their dinner-table and their wife.
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
And when he wanted to refer
Though young he learnt the way to stir
13-15.
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
So, often, while he's still abed,
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
Which to visit first? No matter,
Parading there with all the rest,
Tells him, now is dinner-time.
A birthday party, here a ball.
He'll have time still for the latter.
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Three houses offer a soir�e:
Where will my young idler call?
Until his Breguet's sleepless chime
Meanwhile in his morning dress
16.
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
The French cuisine's finest proof,
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
His beaver-collar shines away,
'Clear the road!' loud sings the cry,
Frost's silver powders on it lie.
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
The Comet's vintage, year eleven.
The pineapple's pure golden unguent.
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
He's off to Talon's, calculating
17.
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
This ruthless critic, legislator,
The artiste's flatterer and traitor,
Of that last cutlet's fiery fat,
An instant hails the entrechat,
To all unfaithful by and by,
The ballet's beat he should be at.
In order to be heard more clearly.
Onegin, to the theatre where
He breathes the air of freedom, at
Glass on glass to drench the heat
As his watch's chimes repeat
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Denizen of the wings, he'll fly
18.
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Satire's most audacious master,
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom's lover,
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
Produced his hive of comedy,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
And Knyazhnin's imitative rhymes.
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
And our Katenin moreover
Land of bewitchment! In past times
Ozerov's tragedies for years
19.
Tired of the laughter of the age,
On any fond face on this stage,
My disenchanted opera-glass,
Listen now to my sad voice.
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Her way again in soulful flight?
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
For all those years long sped by?
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
Silently to yawn and sigh
Turning on the alien mass
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
Are you as you were? Have new
20.
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
To the magic bow in thrall,
The circle claps to make all happen,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
Twists her waist one way, another,
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
The rustling curtain as we breathe
A host of nymphs around her, so
One foot planted, pirouettes
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
Istomina stands, serious
21.
Didelot too is quite the bore.'
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces,
He notes the boxes, serried places,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Then he turns away - and yawns,
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
Threads the rows among the feet,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
'They're all past they're best' he sighs;
'What do I haunt the ballet for?
Askance his opera-glass now centres
22.
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
While weary servants half-awake,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
But our Onegin's off to roam,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
Treading the boards interminably,
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Borne away to change at home.
Their absent masters to berate.
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
While both indoors and outside
The coachmen by the fire free
23.
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
The useful arts, can devise,
And everything Parisian taste,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
That dressing room, all solitary,
For idleness and sense to waste -
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Where fashion's loyal devotee
Ingenious London without cease
Shall I depict with faithful pen
All in our sage's cell appears
24.
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
For teeth or nails, both are served,
China and bronzes fill the table,
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
In human rights, was here all wrong.
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Freedom's champion, ever strong
And to delight the sensual
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
25.
His dressing room, I'll not deceive,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
To enter on the masquerade.
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
A pedant in the details, no less.
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
In masculine attire displayed
Like Venus if she'd condescend
A full three hours at least he'd spend
Before the mirror, then would leave
No reason why a man of energy
26.
Too often by a foreign word,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
I might try to tell the whole tale,
Garbed to the modern taste,
You're curious for every detail,
But there's a risk in such fiction,
Though I'm an adept at description,
It's peppered with them to excess,
No Russian terms exist, confess,
As it is, I ask forgiveness,
The Academic Dictionary.
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
My style is rendered quite absurd
Though I've consulted frequently
27.
That's not the business we've in hand,
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Better to hurry to the ball,
Heads, in profile, edges crop,
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
A flow of silhouetted stills,
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
Onegin has outpaced us all.
Of lovely woman, freakish fop.
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
While behind the window streams
The twin lights of the carriage throw
28.
Through the hall, our hero's there,
A Horse Guard's spurs go jingling,
Orchestra already tiring,
Enters. The room is gyring,
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Past the doorman like an arrow,
The light-footed girls sweep by,
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
A mazurka holds the crowd;
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
While drowned by frantic violins
As ardent glances swiftly fly
29.
Or else.....or else, may God forbid!
My services to you I vow!
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
From my words take warning due,
I dare to write about it so,
In days of dream and ardour,
Pay attention now I beg you,
Guard your daughters most severely,
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
To pass a note of assignation.
For I stopped sinning long ago.
The dance-floor was my passion:
The safest place for a lover
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
30.
That, search all Russia though,
I've wasted far too many hours,
The girls in fashionable dress,
I love youth's frantic energy,
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
You'll not find three lovely pair.
They yet can thrill me in my dreams.
I'd still wander those bright bowers.
Two slender feet...Now sad and cold
Ah, they made me long despair
I still remember, and it seems
I love their little feet, confess
Yet were they wholly innocent
Alas, on every stray amusement
31.
So youth's happiness must pass,
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
My country: exile was my lot,
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
And carpeted voluptuousness.
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
Was it for you all that distress?
Madman, could your heart forget?
On what spring flowers are you set?
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
You left no trace, but loved instead
But where, in what deserted strand
Pampered in eastern luxury
32.
Are enchanting, friends, I find!
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Diana's breast or Flora's cheek,
In winter, resting on the fender,
Or on the ballroom's gleaming floor,
Beneath the table's damask gloss,
In the springtime on the moss,
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Or the granite of the shore.
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Yet Terpsichore's foot I'd seek
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
33.
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
No, passion took no greater toll,
Recall the sea before a storm,
How I envied the waves then,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
To kiss the young Armida's lips,
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Each falling there as they form
Did I so long with painful ardour
How I longed to be those seas
No, never in the fiercest fires
Of tortured youth and its desires
34.
Another day I bring to mind!
Again the pain, again love's art!
Enough of praise though for the proud,
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
They're never worth the singer's fire,
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Again imagination blazes,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
My songs inspired by that crowd.
Yet prove as faithless....as their feet.
The little foot I touch it seems;
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
35.
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
The merchant and the beggar rise,
Blue columns rising over folk,
The city's sounds swiftly wake her,
The punctilious German baker,
To his stand the cabman drives,
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
Has opened up his serving flap.
Crunching over morning snow.
The milkmaids from Ochta go
More than once in white night-cap
But Petersburg that restless heap
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
36.
Free, and in the flower of youth,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
He wakes at noon, or even later,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
Monotonous and varied, say,
The child of luxury and delight.
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
As at the feast he seemed to be?
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Was he as vigorous and carefree
Worn out by the ballroom's noise
And turning morning into night
But was dear Yevgeny content
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
37.
No, for his early feelings faded,
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
And though a womaniser fine,
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Exhausted by society,
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
The object of his constancy;
In the end he too grew bored
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
And fail to offer a word, to make
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Faithlessness was not amusing
Since even he at times would sigh
Not for long were lovely ladies
 38.
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
To blow his brains out, as we're told,
Nothing touched his feelings there,
Or chondria, when we Russians speak,
The cause of which it's time to seek,
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
He'd wander through a drawing room,
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh's power,
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
Yet his life grew sad and cold.
He noticed nothing, did not care.
39-42.
So unapproachable, serene,
You were the first, capricious belles,
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
So blameless in their intellect,
So clever, and so circumspect,
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Though innocent tries one's patience.
Their very presence causes spleen.
He would neglect and then abandon.
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
Today we know, truth to tell
Generally their conversation
Though it's true some woman may
43.
Over the darkened stones instead,
When all of Petersburg's abed,
From every pleasure he retreated,
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Would join the literary bores,
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
All serious effort - no words flow,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
Since, I'm one too and just the same.
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Tried to write, it makes him ill
He yawned inordinately, and so
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
44.
But still found nothing in his head,
The old ones utterly out-dated,
The new ones simply antiquated,
Here no conscience, there no sense,
Across the literary stack,
He chose - a more than worthy goal,
As emptiness possessed his soul,
Like women, books proved a deception,
All chained to their pre-conception,
He drew a mourning veil of black.
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
Great shelves of books he read and read
All's tedium, madness, and pretence
Once more resigned to being idle
45.
Both had wearied of the game,
In both our hearts a dying flame,
I too cast off the social burden,
Both had known Fate's passing fashion,
I liked his face, his manner too,
At that time, and retired from view,
Liked his dreamy tendency,
His unique eccentricity,
I made a friend of Eugene then.
In the morning of our days.
I was bitter, he was gloomy.
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
Both had known the play of passion
All mankind's malicious ways
46.
Enchantment fails such men as he,
With witticisms forged with guile,
But later found it re-assuring,
Cannot but despise it all,
Though it adds to conversation,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
His epigrams topped up with bile.
Lends it charm, intense delight.
The pain of time lost, past recall:
Absorbed by remorse at things done
I thought Onegin's talk disturbing
His virulence, his scorn, alight
He who feels, is quickly taught
He who's lived, he who's thought
47.
Benediction we drank deep!
The sky aglow above the Neva,
Sentimental, free from care,
Like prisoners released in sleep,
In the water's smooth still glass,
To roam the forests green, so us,
With that pale diaphanous light,
How often, on a summer's night,
Recalling romance of time past,
All life, before us, seemed so fair.
Where no face showed of Diana
Recalling many a lost love there
Carried in dream to that land where
In silent joy, of night's bounteous
48.
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Call to each other in the yards,
On the granite parapet,
Leaning, musing pensively,
Sweeter, in night's embrace, by far.
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
A distant strand of singing soars;
Yet Tasso's murmured octaves are
All is still, only the guards
A single boat with outspread oars
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
His heart consumed with regret
49.
I hear the magic of your voice!
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
Where Italy's gold nights descend,
With some fair Venetian face,
Float in a gondola's embrace,
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
Albion's proud lyre I follow,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
Oh Brenta! No: yet I'll rejoice
I'll breathe free, take my ease
My lips from hers will softly prove
50.
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Where I've loved, where I've suffered,
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
It's time to leave this tedious shore,
This hostile climate where I wander,
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
Roam beneath my African sky,
Where my heart has long been smothered.
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
When will my wings begin to soar?
When shall I ever loose my tether?
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
And with southern oceans nigh
51.
Relinquished his inheritance,
Content with life, took a stance,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Hating all this litigation,
Finding it small deprivation,
Each man to his own ideas,
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
He with lawyers round his ears,
And creditors had him at bay,
Then his father passed away,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
Our fates lay in Fortune's hands.
His uncle's frail mortality.
52.
(The place where we began, you see)
Yawning the while as he raced,
The corpse on a table laid,
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
Nature's debt already paid.
Say farewell without delay.
His uncle lay at death's door, better
In fact he soon received a letter
From his uncle's man, to say
53.
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
Now our Eugene's a countryman,
The house was filled with commotion,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Did full justice to the rest,
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are.
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
Were changing with the passing days.
Pleased that they had done their duty.
He who had never once concealed
Friends and enemies from afar
The dead man buried priest and guests
Glad now that his former ways
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
54.
Pursued him endlessly through life,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
No longer even stirred his will,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
He even felt the urge to yawn,
The coolness of the dark glades too,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
For two days it was all quite new,
The solitariness of the meadow,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
Like a shadow, or a wife.
The country caused the same ennui
55.
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
A walk beside the lonely lake,
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
In happiness, in idle ways,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
And spirit finds creative fire.
Dear liberty and leisure.
And far niente is my law.
I once spent my sweetest days?
I was born for quiet existence
In ease and innocence I take
Every dawn produces more
For rural silence, where the lyre
56.
To pair Yevgeny and I,
O country life! I like you all,
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Like Byron, pride's perfect poet,
That I have here daubed my portrait,
To any but ourselves alone.
That Onegin is not me, recall
Of someone other, never own
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
And ignominiously repeat
As though we can never treat
Of over-elaborate slander try
57.
And captive girls by the Salgira,
For whom among that jealous crowd,
All poets, it seems to me,
Sang the maid on mountain high,
Love in imagination,
Your question ringing in my ear,
But now my friends I often hear,
The Muse gave it eternity,
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
'Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
And so in careless rapture I
To dream affection constantly
My soul preserved its memory
58.
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
'Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Love's madness, wild and unruly,
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
I suffered without hope or joy.
To ease heart's suffering, find fame:
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Who in your verse is your goddess?
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
Follow in Petrarch's steps, seem
Rewards with its fond caress
Happy is he who can employ
So he'll double the intensity
59.
A poem in cantos, twenty-five!
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
Then what an epic I'll contrive,
My darkened mind grew clear again,
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
I'm grieving still, but free of tears,
My pen I find no longer wanders,
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
Sketching women's legs and feet,
Beside some lines still incomplete.
Music's magic, thought, and pain.
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
Now free, my verse no longer feared
The storm that shook my soul for years
60.
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
My rhyming novel's well in hand,
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
I've sketched the underlying plan,
Go, little book: find Neva then,
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
And though they're filled with contradiction,
I've scanned the pages of my fiction,
It's not my job to work them through.
I'll feed the proceeds of my pen.
The censors must have work to do.
I'm ready now for chapter two.
The hero's name I've given too;
To journalists for their consumption
Chapter Two
O rus!
Horace
O, the country! O, Russia!
1.
The manor house was quite secluded,
Screened by the hills when storms intruded,
Deepening the garden's shade,
Beside a river. On every side,
Stretched the pastures far and wide,
Was in fact a fine estate,
Here a village, there another,
Cattle grazing in the clover,
Golden cornfields, flowery meadows,
Where the pensive dryads played.
Would thank the heavens for their fate.
Where lovers of life's simple pleasure
Our bored Yevgeny's place of leisure
Parkland, overgrown, soft shadows
2.
Firmly founded on the land,
As such fine mansions ought to be,
Every salon high and handsome,
Damask in the drawing-room,
Ancestral portraits stretched for miles,
Moved our hero, I'll allow,
All this is out of fashion now,
Though why it is, who can say,
With all the taste we used to see.
Both of them would make him yawn.
Stoves shone with ceramic tiles.
The stately pile was nobly planned
An ancient house or one new-born
Yet none of it, the whole display
3.
Killed the flies, and rusticated,
And not the least ink-stain around,
In one a ledger taken hostage,
Settee and table, chests of drawers,
His housekeeper, gazed out the window,
A stoneware jug of cider handy,
In another home-made brandy,
At any more demanding book.
An Almanack, of year eight vintage:
For forty years had berated
Onegin searched the cupboards, found
The old man had no time to look
That simple stall, with oaken floors
In that room, where the aged fellow
4.
Saw nothing good, predicted bad,
His calculating neighbour though,
Yevgeny took, in dreamy sessions,
Alone amongst his new possessions,
He scrapped the old corv�e, no less,
A prophet in the wilderness,
And substituted light quit-rent,
While others sneered at the show,
He's a menace in the first degree.
The serfs applauded his intent.
To running things the modern way;
Was not enamoured, thought him mad
But one and all, in truth, agree
Simply to pass the time away
5.
And he then rapidly skedaddled,
His stallion, a Don thoroughbred,
At first the neighbours visited,
Once he heard, near his abode,
Their carriage wheels, briskly rode,
Wine by the bottle, never blinking,
A mason, and forever drinking,
'The man's a lunatic, a boor,
The brief acquaintances were ended.
Or madam' so they all concur.
They took offence, and once offended
But as, at the back porch, was saddled
Won't kiss the ladies' hands, what's more
Says yes and no, but never sir
6.
The fruits of learning's golden tree,
Newly arrived on his estate,
Handsome, young, a Kantian,
Whose soul was formed in G�ttingen,
Eloquence to inspire the bolder,
His neighbour, caused an equal stir,
Ardent and eccentric thought,
His fervent dreams of liberty,
For reasons that I'll indicate.
A friend of truth: a poet then.
And dark hair hanging to his shoulder.
Vladimir Lensky, is the man
Meanwhile another landowner
From misty Germany he brought
7.
Un-blighted by the world's cold malice,
Over it he'd rack his brains,
With warmth a comrade's manly kiss,
At heart a simple innocent,
To whom hope her brightness lent,
Enchantment, with an unspoiled mind.
A puzzle that seduced, it seems.
Seeking miracles, for his pains.
Or a young girl's shy caress.
In life's fresh glow, he still could find
Life was a riddle, and its goal
The doubts that stirred in his soul
He sweetened with delightful dreams
His generous spirit still could bless
8.
In kindred souls too he believed,
Immortals clasped in fate's embrace,
Who with radiant light would wrestle,
That somewhere there was another,
That there existed chosen vessels,
A future world with their caress.
To his defence should slander lie;
For him alone, the eternal lover;
Who longing to unite them, grieved
Holy friends of the human race
Ready to save his honour, share
Trusted also his friends were there
One day, to illuminate and bless
His prison, loyal, prepared to fly
9.
In his songs kept pride of place,
He never managed to disgrace,
Imbued with true poetic fire,
The world he wandered with his lyre,
Compassion, and indignation,
The bitter-sweet lure of ambition,
Under Goethe's, Schiller's skies,
Moments of grave sublimity,
From the start, had fired his blood.
They the masters, to his eyes.
The charms of sweet simplicity.
For the passions of the heart;
A pure devotion to the good
Blessed with skill, the Muses' art
10.
As a girl's thoughts, unaffected,
He sang of love, to love subjected,
Clear and serene his tune,
A child's slumber, or the moon,
At eighteen years he had the power,
Where on quiet desert strands,
Sailing the untroubled skies,
Misty climes, and vague tomorrows,
He sang of parting and of sorrows,
To sing of life's dry withered flower.
Queen of mysteries and sighs.
His living tears obscured his glance;
Of roses in some high romance;
Sang of all the far-off lands
11.
No flavour of the social game,
The glow of the poetic flame,
Concerning harvesting, or wine,
There of wit, true conversation,
No sentiment to temper reason,
The young man fled their noisy chatter,
Their solid grasp of every matter,
While the babble of their wives,
Alone, to Lensky's taste inclined.
Not such as to engage his mind.
Was dross enough for many lives.
Their family, or the hounds, no shine
In that rural wilderness, Yevgeny
The pleasures of the local gentry
12.
'Come to my golden chamber, love!'
And then she squeaks (Oh Lord, above!)
And Dunya sits to pour the tea,
To a bachelor's sad existence,
Lensky, wealthy and good-looking,
Marry their daughter, was the plan,
They bring on the poor child's guitar,
When he shows, with the samovar,
Before, to prompt her minstrelsy,
To this half-Russian gentleman.
Was thought something of a catch;
Any fish to make a match;
The talk turns with quiet persistence
Thus the country view of hooking
13.
So people (I openly confess)
Like stone and water, ice and flame,
To bear the marriage-yoke as yet,
To each other, but liking grew,
They rode together every day,
They were one instead of two.
Make friends, from sheer idleness.
Onegin's friendship, so they met.
Prose and poetry, in intent.
No two men were less the same
But Lensky, lacking the desire
Wished sincerely to acquire
At first they seemed indifferent
Until, such good friends were they
14.
Yet (as all rules exceptions boast)
And as a rule despised each face,
Though he knew the human race,
Our minds are full of prejudice,
Friendship like that's to us unknown,
Some he liked and placed apart,
Eugene more tolerant than most,
Ourselves the integer in this.
Emotion's only fit for fools.
Valued feelings, with empty heart.
We all possess Napoleon's features;
Are only instruments and tools;
We think the others noughts, alone
The millions of two-legged creatures
15.
His mind, still malleable the while,
He heard our Lensky with a smile,
The poet's bold impassioned speech,
Its doomed despite my interdiction,
Let him but breathe the passing fiction,
With such ephemeral happiness,
His gaze inspired: how he could preach! -
Its madness and its rage to live.
Words upon his lips were still.
Believe all things are for the best:
Youth is a fever, let's forgive
He thought: what folly to work ill
The sarcastic and the chill
All this fresh to Onegin, till
16.
Listening with tolerance,
Recited, as in reverie,
Yevgeny heard with condescension,
The histories of every nation,
The prejudices of the ages,
Good and evil, what science taught,
Sparked a deeper train of thought,
Of life itself and destiny,
Though they seemed devoid of sense.
Were all their constant study.
The poet burning with opinion
Between them every disputation
The secrets of the grave, the pages
Bits of Northern poetry
17.
With parting, vengeance with a word,
With his relations and his wife,
Onegin spoke of them with care,
Happier he who never knew them,
But most of all they talked of passions,
Happy the one who has passed by,
Finding all jealousy absurd -
To keep from the gambling table.
My two youthful hermits there;
Dispassionately gave a sigh;
He who yawns away his life
Whose capital he's proved able
Who has cooled love's agitation
Having escaped those stormy regions
18.
When passions' flames have wavered,
Of rationality and peace,
The history of the passing gale,
The veteran is stirred, grows pale,
When their unbridled stirrings cease,
And in his hut, with a will,
That even now can stir us so,
We still tremble, being sober,
To hear the tale told by another,
And all their echoes false to us,
Listens to the young bloods still.
When to the flag we have gathered
Just as at wars of long ago
Their violence seems ridiculous
19.
As a veteran, solemn faced,
Considering himself, so placed,
Could never yet conceal a thing,
Love, or hate, it shouts the truth,
He gave heart and soul expression,
His youthful love, warm and tender,
Telling the story of his ardour,
Of every joy and suffering.
Onegin heard the poet's confession.
That to us is nothing new.
Besides, the enthusiasm of youth
Of all that sentimental stew
Ingenuous, trusting, earnestly
Swiftly apprising Yevgeny
20.
Possessed of the poet's finer rage,
Nor hours given to the Muse,
That distance, quencher of belief,
Ever habitual pain and grief,
Could alter Lensky's loyal soul,
Always the one pure constant dream,
Ever desire's habitual stream,
Nor long years of separation,
Nor study, nor loud celebration,
Nor foreign beauties, foreign views,
His virgin fire a living coal.
Is doomed to feel such love, and moan:
Oh, he had loved as in our age
One loves no longer; one alone
21.
When but a boy his heart was captured,
Filled with grace and innocence,
Humbly living out existence,
Never having felt love's blade,
A flower in deepest grass, alone,
Their fathers saw them marrying,
Under the oak-trees' sheltering boughs,
They exchanged their childish vows,
A lily in the morning dew,
He watched her as she sang and played.
Considered it a certain thing.
To bee and butterfly unknown.
By Olga, and as one enraptured
Under her parent's gaze she grew
22.
Oh, farewell now, the golden days!
In him the poet's exaltation,
His first pipings were of her,
He sought the forest's shadowy ways,
And the moon's celestial light,
Solitude, silence, dark of night,
The moon, a lamp in the sky,
Our secret balm, a tear, a sigh...
Thoughts of her his inspiration.
A street-light, though inferior.
To which we dedicated then
Our wanderings and again
Yet now we only see in her
Olga was the first to stir
23.
Reader, I'll enhance the vista,
Novel that you choose to read,
A charming portrait, yes, indeed,
Like the poet's life as simple,
Of sky-blue eyes, a heavenly blue,
Always humble, always truthful,
Always smiling as the dawn,
Flaxen hair, all gleaming, too,
Voice, manner, slender waist,
One I adored, but now it bores me.
Let me describe her elder sister.
Such was Olga...you can paste
Sweet as the kiss of love, that's born
Her description here from any
24.
(To say nothing of our verse),
Her sister's name was...Tatyana,
Why not? It has a pleasant sound,
It's true we don't possess good taste,
And the servants' quarters! No,
From memories of long ago,
It's been willingly displayed.
By affectation - not the rest.
In our regard, has left us blessed
Although inseparable I've found
Here's the first use of it made
In the names that we rehearse
Enlightenment has been a waste
In romance, the first time ever
25.
Like a doe seen in a clearing,
Melancholy, wild, retiring,
Fleeing at the sign of danger,
Lacking rosy cheeks, the manner,
Not a beauty like her sister,
To delight in childish play,
So, she is called Tatyana.
She'd sit all day in solitude.
With the others, sweetly dancing.
To her family a stranger.
To attract a passing lover.
But often to the window glued
She never took to caressing
Her father, mother, not her way
26.
A needle, never once excelled,
Her head above the silk inclined,
Her dearest friend was reverie,
The child with her obedient doll,
Prepares herself for protocol,
Early, the will to rule appears,
For social worlds beyond her years,
In working something she'd designed.
Enriched by meditative dream.
What mother preaches constantly.
Her tender fingers never held
From the cradle, the slow stream
Repeating to it solemnly
Of placid dull rusticity
27.
Tatyana had no doll to nurse,
News from town, the latest craze,
Their laughter noisy, tedious,
Were what gave her most delight,
Olga's little friends to play,
At tag in the meadows, say,
She never chose to rehearse.
Their raucous games so frivolous.
Told in winter, late at night.
Tatyana such things rejected;
And when nurse had collected
Childhood mischief, petty glories
Were not her forte; horror stories
But even in her earliest days
28.
On her balcony, alone,
The East is indolently white,
Still hold half the world in thrall,
Stirs the breeze, brings on the morn,
When the light has barely shown,
At the same hour's sweet caress,
She loved to greet the break of day,
As the stars' choir fades away,
And the edge of earth grows brightly,
As the half-light turns to dawn.
By candle-light she'd rise and dress.
And lost in misty moonlight all
In winter when the shades of night
While, herald of the morning, lightly
29.
And since he never read a page,
His wife was quite another one,
Her father saw no harm in reading,
Her great delight, she loved them so,
From the first she craved romances,
Whatever chapter most entrances,
He thought them quite innocuous,
About the volume's true content,
His taste was of a former age.
Since she was mad for Richardson.
That slept beneath her pillow thus.
In Richardson or in Rousseau.
A decent sort, though yet conceding
And never bothered for a moment
30.
Long ago, Princess Alina,
Though not indeed that she was one,
Of whom she could not get her fill,
Times from her dear Moscow cousin,
To his Lovelace, Grandison,
When, betrothed, she had seen her,
She was sighing for another,
Who pleased her very soul, a lover,
Her Grandison, adept at cards,
Richardson she loved quite madly,
A dandy, ensign in the Guards.
Betrothed though against her will:
But she had heard of them a dozen
To read him, nor preferred really
31.
Would soon settle his new wife)
Like him she wore the latest fashion,
But regardless of such passion,
With God knows who for neighbour,
For his estate, where she, bereft,
Habit brought her quiet content,
Looked for a divorce tomorrow,
Wept violently in her sorrow,
Then plunged into domestic labour.
Like him her dress was elegant.
Habit joy's surrogate, heaven sent.
They wed her, without her consent.
(Though he thought that country life
Her prudent husband, swiftly left
32.
Beat the servant girls and cursed,
She quietly took her husband's measure,
Nothing else could end her grief,
Pickled mushrooms for the winter,
With that secret, gave her dictat,
All went smoothly from that day,
Of levied serfs, bathed Saturday,
Habit soothed her agony,
Consoled her and brought relief.
And ruled him like an autocrat.
And never asked her husband first.
In their hours of work and leisure
Kept the books, and shaved the hair
Until a fresh discovery
33.
In the album of some sweet friend,
Her sing-song voice in gossip blend,
Time was when she would write, in blood,
Life without albums, waists, Pauline,
Books of sentimental verse,
And wore, her last defences down,
Where French sounds were de rigeur,
Pinched her waist with tight laces,
Names like Akulka, not C�line.
A mob-cap and a quilted gown.
Call Praskovya, Pauline, and would
All forgotten, and rehearse
But in the end came to prefer
Used the nasal 'n' in places
 34.
Laugh at whatever tickles them,
Hours roll on, and then, again,
Olga's here with tea to sip,
They'll grumble, swap the latest gossip,
Peacefully their lives progress,
Sometimes they receive as guests,
Let her pursue her own sweet way,
Then supper, bedtime, by and by,
Yet her spouse loved her dearly,
Trusted her himself, quite clearly,
And dined with her d�shabill�.
The hour when all must say goodbye.
Plain, devoid of ceremony.
Some decent neighbouring family
35.
On the flowers, their eyes quite red,
And at the table, dinner served,
They held to, in their peaceful state,
The congregation sit and yawn,
Folksongs, and the wedding chorals,
Twice a year, loved Christmas carols,
When through the thanksgiving Mass,
Like fresh air they loved their kvass,
Traditions of the ages past,
Due rank and custom they observed.
Their sentiments were re-born.
At Whitsuntide, their tears they'd shed
So on Shrove Tuesday always ate
Russian pancakes, and they'd fast
36.
He'd led a good and simple life,
And so grew old, like all things mortal,
Through the grave's gloomy portal,
God's servant and a brigadier,
Dimitry Larin, a poor sinner,
Now he rested from his labours,
And was wept for by his neighbours,
By his children and his wife.
Beneath this stone, rests quietly here.
And died just before his dinner.
Wore the funeral crown at last.
His epitaph discreetly sighs:
Where his honoured dust now lies
The husband was the first to pass
37.
Took his old medal for a toy!
'Shall I live to see that day?'
And full of grief that he was dead,
Alas, poor Yorick!' he lamented,
'In his arms I played, contented,
He hoped Olga and I would wed,
Went to pay his fond respects,
Even now I hear him say,
When I was but a little boy,
Elegy penned a madrigal.
Paid tribute with a tear. 'Who's next?
Lensky, for a funeral
Returning to his home, young Lensky
At his neighbour's grave, and truly
38.
To crowd us out before our time!
Rise and ripen, briefly nourished,
Honouring, where they lay sleeping,
Then too, with fervent weeping,
Grows recklessly and fills the room,
He sat down and wrote another,
The human harvest to our eyes,
Where they fall, others flourish...
Both his father and his mother...
Pushes its grandsires to the tomb.
We too, we too, the same old way;
Our grandchildren think it no crime
Alas! From life's dark furrows rise
So our heedless race today
39.
Of this fickle life, my friends!
To leave a name for fate to find,
Yet within my heart's confusion,
I'm blind to all its illusion,
I count myself free of its power,
Leaving not a trace behind.
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
Know its worth, and how it ends.
Distant hopes will sometimes start:
I live, I write but not for praise;
So, enjoy the fleeting hour
But only, it seems, from my days
It would be painful to depart
That one line in the memory
40.
The ageing laurels of my crown!
Pronouncing: 'He was a poet!'
Perhaps too (oh, flattering hope!)
Some fool may yet achieve a trope,
But you, disciple of the Muse,
Some stanza, preserved by fate,
Whose kind hand will smooth like down,
Receive my thanks, and grateful dues,
Even though he cannot know it,
Some fragment of my precious art,
My verse may touch someone's heart,
Who keep my pyramid from rust,
Saved from Lethe's darkened spate.
While pointing out my famous bust.
Chapter Three
Elle �toit fille, elle �toit amoureuse.
Malfil�tre
She was a girl, she was amorous.
1.
'You're off again? Oh, these poets!'
About the weather, crops, and cattle...'
Goodbye, Eugene, I must be leaving.'
Killing the hours dozing there?'
You fritter away your evenings?'
Hospitable, a family grind,
Aren't you bored to death, dear God,
Tea, and jam, and endless prattle,
- 'Not at all.' - 'Well, I declare,
A simple Russian scene, by night,
'I'll not keep you, but where is it,
- 'At the Larins.' - 'How very odd.
I imagine (say, if I'm right):
I can't see it. Here's what you'll find
2.
Where we can...' 'Oh, an elegy!
Dear Lord, enough, enough! Have pity!
'Ah, boredom, that's what's bad, my friend.'
Introduce me.' 'Now, you're jesting.'
They'd welcome you with great delight.'
'I don't see what's so bad about it.'
All make for home in the end,
This Phyllis, who's so interesting,
This idol for your mind, and pen,
'I hate the fashionable circuit,
Your tears, verse, et cetera, when? ...
'No.' - 'With pleasure.' - 'When?' - 'Tonight.
You're really going? And so swiftly?
But, listen, Lensky, when shall I see
3.
Until (a wealth of thanks conceive),
And passed the time as people do,
Those dishes of preserves appear,
Politely mentioning various topics,
Custom demands. They sat and sat,
Time dragged slowly or it flew,
'Let's go.' They leave without delay,
Arrive, and greeted heartily,
They exit; Lenksy loth to leave.
With old-fashioned hospitality.
Filling the silences with gossip:
The polished table shines, I fear
Jugs of cranberry juice, all that
Are treated in the kindest way
4.
Oh, this stupid countryside!
Press on! Andryushka, quicker, quicker!
'My dear Onegin, you're yawning.'
It's bound at least to make me ill.'
So: Madame Larina, while we ride,
'A habit Lensky.' 'You find life boring,
Too dark for driving some would claim,
I found an honest plain old dear,
Homeward they go the shortest way,
Then listen now, in secret, with me.
More than usual?' 'No, the same.
Though that cranberry juice may kill:
Since it's late, and travel quickly:
Reader, you'd know what they say?
5.
The foolish horizon honours.'
'And tell me, which was Tatyana?'
'Can you really love the younger?'
As though she had a private sorrow'
Sad as Zhukovsky's Svetlana,
Pretty yes, with that round face,
As the foolish moon in space,
Vladimir thought him quite wrong,
Olga's less alive by far,
- Why not? - Well, I'd prefer her sister,
Just like those Van Dyck Madonnas,
'The one who sat by the window,
Yet diplomatic, held his tongue.
If I were a poet, as you are
6.
Tatyana was betrothed: some knew!
Some claimed the marriage was agreed,
On one and all a strong impression,
There was no end of speculation,
Hosts of rumours in circulation,
Jokes and carping comments too,
As for Lensky's fate, you know,
Stated it quite positively,
Delayed though, temporarily,
All the neighbours were seduced.
Fashionable rings they need.
All that was settled long ago.
At the Larins had produced
Meanwhile Onegin's first session
7.
For that fatal sustenance,
Fired by longing, circumstance,
Her dreams had long since set her yearning,
In solitude her heart was burning,
Heated by the warmth of spring,
Crushed by adolescent gloom,
Felt inexpressible elation,
Tatyana listened, with vexation,
To all this; yet, an innocent,
A thought took root in her heart,
And time gives nurture to the thing.
At the least unguarded moment.
Her soul was waiting...but for whom?
So a seed begins to start
8.
Her eyes are opened, it is he!
His presence: kindness is vexation,
Curses their hours of idleness,
Hates the tedium of their visit,
All things declare, and magically,
Their visits an unwelcome folly,
Lost in her deep melancholy,
In dreams, that fevered, solitary,
The servant's looks pure irritation.
Their tendency to sit, and sit.
The one awaited....he is here;
Now night and day he will appear
She pays no attention to their guests
Speak of him, and endlessly
9.
In those soft seductive glances!
Every writer's fine creation,
Finds a deeper fascination,
Each figment of imagination,
Now with greater concentration,
And the peerless Grandison,
The lover too of Rousseau's Julie Womar,
Cottin's Malek-Adhel, de Krudener's de Linar,
Werther, born to be a martyr,
She reads the sweet romances,
In Onegin's form, and soul.
A single image as it were:
Who sends me to sleep, all were as one;
The foolish dreamer sees them whole
10.
Yet ours, though he may be one,
To find her passion, and her dream,
Through its pages swiftly combs,
Of all the authors she admires,
With some dangerous volume roams,
Another's joy, another's sorrow,
Her overflowing heart, love's gleam.
Is certainly no Grandison.
In her mind she writes, addresses.
Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine;
And sees herself the heroine
A little note then for her hero
She sighs and in herself possesses
Wanders among forest choirs
11.
Always unjustly persecuted,
To show intelligence and grace,
Pure devotion his desire,
His heart forever burned with rapture,
Vice was ruthlessly put down,
And always, in the final chapter,
In the high style of the past,
A sensitive and handsome face.
A paragon of pure perfection.
While virtue won a noble crown.
Prepared for sacrificial fire:
His character was executed
An author of romantic fiction
Had to present his hero as
12.
Her idol, someone to admire,
Is the blood-sucking Vampire,
Now disturbs a young girl's slumber,
Melmoth, Maturin's traveller,
Lord Byron with a shrewd despair,
The Corsair or the Wandering Jew,
But now our minds are somewhat cloudy,
Even in books, virtue's dowdy,
As saturnine romanticism.
Nodier's Jean Sbogar too.
And even there, at last, vice wins.
Morals makes us nod, not sins;
Displays a hopeless egotism
All the British Muse's lumber
13.
Perhaps by some divine decree,
With that my readers I'll regale,
No fear and menace in my tale,
Defying then the dread Apollo,
No villain's hidden agony,
Our ancient customs shall rehearse.
To fill up my declining days.
Self, and end my poetry.
My friends, where's the sense in it?
Love's enchantments: and my verse
Write novels in established ways
A fresh demon will inhabit
The paths of humble prose I'll follow
A simple Russian family
14.
Words that flowed from my tongue,
I'll recall the words of longing,
At my mistress's feet lying,
A second quarrel, then they sigh,
Tears of reconciliation,
Fierce jealousy, sad separation,
Of an old uncle, or some father's,
In a time far, far from this,
Uttered in those days of bliss,
Then to the altar, by and by....
Lost now that power of being young.
The breathless meeting of young lovers;
Then by the stream, beneath the beech
I'll record the honest speech
15.
Tatyana, my dear Tatyana!
While fated everywhere to find,
But first what hopes you'll cherish,
My dear one you're doomed to perish,
To the hands of fashion's monster,
You'll learn its bliss, its desires,
Blinded, dazed by sombre joys,
You'll drink the poison love employs,
While such dreams pursue you,
Your true seducer in your mind.
You now consign your fate.
I share those tears that agitate:
To shelter lovers' trysts aspires;
Thinking every place you view
16.
Haunted by love's pain, Tatyana,
The breath on her lips is glazed,
Burning suddenly with shame,
Her breast heaves, her cheeks aflame,
Tatyana, in the darkness lying,
The vault of heaven. Near her room,
Eyes downcast, till her languor,
A roaring in her ears, eyes dazed...
To her nurse is softly sighing.
Prevents her from even moving.
Its rich sonorous cadence rolls.
Takes to the garden, walking
A nightingale, from woodland gloom
Night falls, and the moon patrols
17.
'I can't sleep, Nurse; it's stifling!
Were you in love? I must know!'
Open the window then sit by me.'
Nurse, I'm bored, tell me a story.'
I'm muddled now!'... 'But Nurse, tell me,
'A story, Tanya? In my time,
I knew scores and scores, in rhyme,
When you were young, long ago,
All that I knew forgotten. Yes,
Time's done it's work, I must confess,
Tanya, it's gone, my memory,
'What is it Tanya, dear?' 'It's trifling:
With Evil spirits, a lovely maiden;
Old tales they were, fables laden
18.
And sang me to church. What a pair!'
Would chase me about, fit to die.'
Then how did you come to wed?' 'Tanya,
It was God's will now, my Vanya,
Oh, you should have heard me crying,
Still wept as they unwound my hair,
To persuade my parents, no less,
'Tanya! What a notion! In those days,
And my mother-in-law, bless her ways,
Us then, and I, I was just thirteen.
Then father blessed me, and said yes.
The matchmaker spent two weeks trying
We'd never heard the word. One sigh
Was just a lad, if you could have seen
19.
I long to sob, I long to weep...!'
I'm...Nurse, you see...I'm in love.'
My husband's folk...do you hear?'
- 'Oh my child, Heavens above,
It seems to me I'm ill, my dear,
Let me sprinkle you, fetch holy water,
'So I joined another family,
'Ah, Nurse, Nurse, I'm so unhappy,
May the Good Lord preserve us still!' -
Oh Lord! What can I get you, daughter...
Over the girl, and trembling prayed.
- 'My little one, you need to sleep.
You're in a fever...' 'No, I'm not ill:
The sign of the cross she made
20.
The nurse. 'It's love. Leave me alone.'
In kerchief and quilted gown,
'Dear, you can't be well,' replies,
'I am in love' Tatyana sighs,
On the girl's pale beauty gleams,
Meanwhile, the sad moon dreams,
Silvering loosened hair, tears bright,
And all the world lies still, below,
By our heroine sits, spell-bound.
In a soft whisper, gives a moan.
Bathed in the moon's enchanted glow.
The bench beside her, where the nurse
Shines above, its tranquil light
21.
To sleep later. Now goodnight.'
Thinking of Eugene, all the while,
A simple letter, free of guile,
Tanya watches the moon's sphere,
Propped on her elbow, now she pens,
Her soul in distant regions wanders,
The letter's done, is folded, sealed...
That breathes a young girl's innocence.
Alone, in silence. The moon sheds light.
And then, a sudden thought shines clear:
'Nurse, go now.' She swiftly ponders:
Tatyana! Whose name is revealed?
That table nearer; I'll be sure
'Bring me ink and paper, draw
22.
All hope, all you who enter here.'
As pure as winter's ice, as rigid,
Unfathomable, even to the bold,
I've known women, proud and cold,
I marvelled at their arrogance,
Iron virtue, chilly glance,
Perhaps you've seen, on Neva's shore,
What consoles them is our fear,
And that inscription on their brow,
To keep well clear of them, I vow,
As stern, as distant, and as frigid.
The like of them, one or more.
They abhor it when we're tender.
The one on Hades' Gate: Surrender
23
Them often feign a change of mind,
At least their words seeming more,
Young and fond, pursue again,
Ringed by loyal devotees,
Indifferent to me or you,
At least a pretence of empathy,
So the gullible would blindly,
Kind and tender than before.
That fatal sweetness, though in vain.
To sighs, or praise, or flatteries.
Reviving it the following day:
And yet I was amazed to find
And I've seen other beauties too
Frightening a timid love away
24.
A soul for passion's fires designed,
And by Heaven has been blessed,
A fiery will, a lively mind,
Surely, then, you can forgive,
With profound imagination,
Because her simplicity, it seems,
Or because her love lacks art,
A fierce desire to love and live?
A spirit tuned to all creation?
Believes completely in her dreams?
Follows the promptings of her heart?
Why then consider Tanya guilty?
Is ignorant of deceit, and still she
Because she's trusting, and honest
25.
Tatyana is no cool coquette,
Lest tired of pleasure, freedom won,
She loves in all seriousness,
Exhaust him, now, let him doubt,
Then calmly stir his jealousy,
Him hope, deploy uncertainty,
He ends the struggle and has done.
Full of innocence and sweetness.
To mesh him deeper in our net.
Till the flame is dying out;
First rouse his vanity and let
Yields to it like a child, as yet
She'd never argue: Let's delay
Increase love's value, find a way
26.
Her love thus, since, despite its force,
Our great language, in its pride,
I must give her letter, error-free,
Had never, even when young,
Since, to preserve my reputation,
What's to be done? As we all know,
But Tanya wrote it all so badly,
Never read Russian papers, sadly,
Now, I'm in some difficulty,
And so she wrote in French of course ...
Has never with letters been allied.
Been fluent in her native tongue.
In Russian, honouring our nation.
No lady's ever deigned to show
27.
Izmailov's Journal set before her!
To read in Russian. Ah, what horror!
To whom our hearts were consecrated,
Didn't they mutilate our speech,
For whom, to expiate our crimes,
We wrote all those secret rhymes,
Could you conceive those golden curls,
A foreign tongue it is that slips,
Is it not true, my fellow poet,
Those dear creatures, oh, you know it,
Habitually, between their lips.
Fault was charming, though it grated?
Our Russian language, and yet each
I know: they'd like to force our girls
28.
An Academician in a bonnet!
Like rose-red lips without a smile,
Russian without such faults is vile,
May I never meet, at a ball,
A scholar, in a yellow shawl,
Lacks charm. The new generation,
May yet accustom us to grammar,
Of beauties, with the press's clamour,
As for me....they're not my ways,
By the entrance step, or on it,
My heart is with the good old days.
Make poetry their occupation;
29.
I've not the strength for repentance,
French still entrances in a sentence,
Their errors of pronunciation,
Their incorrect and careless chatter,
Still add emotion to the matter,
Enough. It's time for that letter,
Like the sins that youth rehearses,
Written by my pure young beauty,
I gave my word, and it's my duty,
Stir the same old sweet sensation.
In these far less tender times.
Or Bogdan�vich's light verses.
Though blank pages would be better;
We've no use for Parny's rhymes
30.
Borrow your bewitching skill,
Translate my Tanya, with a will,
But no, beneath Finland's skies,
Far now from praise, he sighs,
Into verse that would amaze us,
Where are you, now? It's your right,
And ask your Muse to take a bow,
Baratynsky, were you with me now,
Singer of Feasts and melancholy,
I cede my own in deference.....
Among sad cliffs for preference.
All those foreign words and phrases.
To all my plaintive misery.
In spirit, he abandons me
I might commit a daring folly
31.
As an air from Weber's Freisch�tz played,
Tayana's letter's here before me,
I treat it as a sacred treasure,
I know not, yet here's my translation,
Pale, incomplete, an imitation,
Who taught her this intense emotion,
This heartfelt speech, gave the notion,
Who inspired such tenderness,
Read it secretively, sadly,
By nervous hands, mind half-obeyed.
And never fully plumb its measure.
Surrender's language, rare excess?
So charming and so perilous?
Of a living work, as dubious
TATYANA'S LETTER TO ONEGIN
And then, while you were gone,
Utter a few words of greeting,
Be in your presence, hear you speak,
To see you but once a week,
Have that to think, and think, upon,
In your thoughts, you would wait,
At first I wished to stay quite silent,
And we....don't shine in any way,
Of shame or misery, one word.
And not abandon me to fate.
Day and night, till our next meeting.
To punish me with your derision.
Although we welcome you, so gladly.
That the country bores you, sadly;
How shall I add to my confession?
'I write - what more is there to say?
Thus, you never would have heard
If I'd reserved a hope, content
I know it's in your power today
Yet had compassion a part to play
You're unsociable, they say
Been spared this deep inquietude,
Found another, served at last,
This fever born of youth once past,
My world with equanimity,
As wife and mother, faithfully.
Lost in our rural solitude?
Why did you come, to disturb us?
In time (who knows?) I might have viewed
I'd not have known you, and thus
Long ago....It was no phantom!
On earth but you my heart adores!
My hearts ablaze, I cried: 'It's he',
Vision, standing by my bed,
In quiet, did you not speak to me,
As yet unknown, I held you dear,
My soul heard your voice ring clear,
Of our prophetic meeting: yes,
You appeared to me in dreams,
Stirred by a stranger's glance, it seems,
To bring, with love and solace bright,
And now, at this very moment,
The hours of anguished prayer I knew,
God sent you to me, I avow,
You appeared, and instantly,
That was ordained by fate, alone...
Till in the grave we shall rest...
In my thoughts, I was struck dumb.
It's Heaven's will: I am yours.
Is it not true? I often heard you:
Fresh hope on which my heart is fed?
When my head ached so painfully?
Another? ....No, no there's none
In works of charity, all through
Deep, in the translucent night
Is it not you, this heaven-sent
My life was but a pledge till now
Speak the reproach I have earned!
Dispel my doubts, I am blind,
The fancies of a foolish mind,
Are you then my guardian angel,
Me, or understand my moan,
In your hands, my direction,
The tears flow from my eyes,
Towards me, wake hope in my heart,
Perhaps this is all vanity,
Mine another destiny....
I beseech your protection...
Silently, I'm doomed to perish.
My mind in torment, I'm alone:
Or my tempter, force of evil:
I await you: one look turned
Conceive it. No one here to cherish
So be it! My fate now lies
Or make this painful dream depart
I tremble to re-read....must end!
Boldly trusting in your honour...'
My heart sinks now, in shame and terror...
On you alone I must depend
32.
Morning comes: the dark is done,
Tatyana moans then gives a sigh,
Is turned to silver. From it's dream,
Her head sinks, the stars grow older,
Her night-dress slips from her shoulder,
Soon the dawn will bring new light,
The moon no longer shines as bright,
The wafer meant to seal it's dry,
A shepherd's pipe wakes the dale.
To my Tatyana, all is one.
Still quivering there on her tongue.
The letter trembles in her hand;
The radiance dies: there the vale
Shines with mist. Here a stream
33.
Last night what a fright you gave me!
Save us, how well you're looking!
Ah, now but you're up already!
Red as a poppy, your bright face.'
The nurse, old Filipevna,
I see your fretting's left no trace,
See, my early bird, my darling,
The seal with her monogram,
She barely notices the dawn,
Enters softly and disturbs her,
Bringing breakfast on a tray,
Poised above the letter's folds.
'It's time to rise my child; it's day:
Sits with head downcast, still holds
34.
'Of course not darling, only say...'
My sweet child, as God is holy.'
I can't count them if I try.'
And never breathe a word of it,
I know I'm slow, and short of wit,
To our neighbour... he, you know,
And he must never mention me...' -
- 'Oh, Nurse, you won't refuse me.' -
No suspicions... nurse, obey.' -
Must take this letter, secretly, to O...
- 'Don't think...truly...don't accuse me...
'To whom, my dear, who is this he?
- 'Then send your grandson, and he
But we've so many neighbours, why
35.
When I was young, a mere suggestion...'
Child, is there something you need?'
It's for Onegin.' - 'Yes, indeed,
Once master had no need to scold,
This letter here, don't you see,
What has all that to do with me,
- 'Nurse, now, that's not the question,
Old, Tanya, and my mind...God bless,
Don't be cross with me, my sweet,
- 'Nurse, how slow you are to guess!' -
Go now, take this note of mine.' -
 - 'Nurse, it's nothing, I feel fine.
My mind....But you're pale as a sheet:
'My darling, well, I'm getting old;
36.
A shadow, pale. Ah, for one line!
'It seems he has forgotten us!'
Perhaps the mail's caused some delay,'
'Tell me will your friend appear?'
Tanya downcast, as if she heard,
Dressed at dawn, she gives a sigh,
Another day, and still no sign,
Asks Larina, curious,
'He promised he'd come, today,
The day slips past, with no reply,
A dark reproach in every word.
Tanya was blushing, trembling.
Then Olga's suitor, Lensky's here:
She heard our Lensky answering;
37.
Her little finger's traced, I see,
Breathing on the icy pane,
It glows and hisses, softly steaming,
Adorns the table, boiling hot,
On the misted glass, a shadow,
Tatyana hovers at the window,
The sacred letters, O and E.
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
Vapour wreathes the china pot.
A drop of that dark fragrant stream;
She's lost in thought now, once again;
Dusk falls, the samovar is gleaming
Olga's there, and quietly fills
The shining tea-cups, never spills
38.
Her heartache feels like some disease,
At nothing, pathway, lake, or copse,
Tatyana flies, as swift as faith,
Through the borders, gains the stream,
Breaks the lilacs, hurrying on,
Past the flowers, down the lawn,
Past the bridge, and pond, she stops,
Her eyes are clouded, filled with tears,
Not looking backward for an instant,
From porch to yard, in a moment,
Her. Galloping, closer it appears.
The sound of hooves! ...Sent to freeze
'Eugene! Ah!' - Light as a wraith
And on the rustic bench's gleam
39.
Oh God, what must he think of me?'
Preventing them from doing wrong!)
Picking berries in the evening,
A clever scheme of rural song,
It's clear they're not eating them,
(As their master told them to,
Her heart still, in it's agony,
Sinks to rest...
Is this him, now? She cannot hear.
Still bears a hope, a dream darkly.
She trembles, burning, in fear:
By slyly thieving one or two;
Far off a choir of girls sing
Not daring to stop, for then
THE GIRLS' SONG
Foot it sweetly, on the grass!
What we sing's not meant for you!
And draw to us a handsome lad,
Let's surround him, in a trice,
Listen to our secret song,
A song we love, a merry song,
When we see our lad approach,
Never spy on what we do,
Sing a song, unbind your hair,
Pelt him, with ripe red cherries,
Come away, my pretty ones,
Come you maidens, pretty maidens,
When we see him, when he's near us,
Foot it sweetly, now and neatly,
To our dance, to our choir.
Raspberries, sweet redcurrants:
Eavesdropper, don't you dare
40.
Still the throbbing is fierce,
Waiting there, her cheeks on fire,
Or a hare trembles, hapless thing,
To beat once more its rainbow wing,
Tatyana hears their distant choir,
But still the pounding in her ears,
But scarcely comprehends their art,
Tries to calm her beating heart,
By some careless lad for sport,
The huntsman by the hedge, concealed.
And the flame in her cheek.
Glimpsing from the distant field
So a poor butterfly will seek
Frantic and quivering, caught
41.
She halts, as if scorched by flame,
Standing there, his eyes ablaze,
At last she gave a sudden sigh,
And rose from the bench again,
It is Yevgeny,' sees him plain,
But the end to this encounter,
After such unremitting labour,
So unlooked-for, I'll not give it,
Lack the strength just now to live it,
A walk indeed would suit me best,
Turned, and saw before her: 'Why,
Rooted to the ground, in shame.
As lightning in his visage plays.
Before I meditate the rest.
Chapter Four
La morale est dans la nature des choses.
Necker
Morality is in the nature of things.
1-7.
Fit only for our grandsire's stage,
Gone, with the fashions we abuse,
And praised to the skies above,
Considered as the art of love,
The less we show our love to woman,
The easier to snare and ruin,
The easier she is to win,
We've toppled Lovelace as we ought,
That serious and heartless sport,
Old monkeys of another age.
In seduction's net of sin.
Wigs and scarlet-heeled shoes.
Once cold-blooded lechery
Was praised, all that debauchery
8.
To bear on things we've all eschewed,
Aunts and mothers keeping house,
Who is not bored with evasion,
Tired of repeating platitudes,
Letters running to six pages,
Who's not exhausted by their rages,
Hearing the same outworn objections,
Threats, entreaties, vows and fears,
Deceit, and slander, rings and tears,
The heavy friendship of a spouse?
In little girls of scarce thirteen?
To prejudices rarely seen
Bringing the science of persuasion
Administering the same corrections
9.
In the sound, and silence cold,
Then disenchantment, bored desire,
That sad protest in his soul,
Some girl, delighted that he's found her,
Hearing in the crowd, and after,
Spoilt by each casual encounter,
Eight years he killed, hour by hour,
Of follies fit to test the courts,
Unbridled passion was his truth.
Squandered youth, life's finest flower.
Such were my Yevgeny's thoughts.
Stifling a yawn with laughter:
Yet bored again by conquest's mire;
For he was victim from his youth
10.
Indifferently, the game is done,
He leaves again, and home has gone,
Sleeps soundly, passes thus his days,
A casual guest comes, sits and plays,
Their loss, without pain or regret,
So, for an evening game of whist,
Refused - found consolation swiftly,
Distanced from the claims of beauty,
Their love, their hatred, went un-missed.
He followed still, for customs sake.
Deceived - a welcome rest would take.
As to where he'll spend his evening.
With not a thought in the morning
He sought them without joy, and met
11.
Yet now, receiving Tanya's note,
The tender style in which she wrote,
He plunged, head first, into the stream,
Perhaps the ancient flame of passion,
But we must to the garden go,
Thrilled him in its former way,
Her pallor, and her melancholy,
Her face possessed his memory,
The simple girlish way she loved.
A harmless, and delightful dream.
A soul so trusting, in that fashion.
Where Tanya met him, as we know.
Onegin's heart was deeply moved;
Though he'd no wish to betray
12.
I'll leave the verdict up to you.'
For two long minutes neither spoke,
Your candour: that is dear to me,
Don't disavow it, I find here,
But hear my confession through,
And then Onegin approached her,
That's no ready compliment,
It brought to life, instantly,
A love that's innocent, sincere.
The seal, I have read your letter.
I'll requite, with your assent:
Those feelings, so long quiescent;
Saying: 'You wrote to me, I broke
All that you sincerely meant
13.
And be as happy...as I could!
Token of every beauty, good,
Then truly, in this life,
I'd find in you my heart's ideal,
Find that youthful folly real,
No rhetoric, no flattery,
A cure for my sad history,
For but a moment, mind and sense -
You alone would be my wife.
My life with the domestic round;
A role as husband, father; found
Could kindly fate for me prescribe
'Could I happily circumscribe
My being in family existence
14.
Believe me (conscience is my guide)
However I wished to prove true,
Then you would weep, yet your tears,
'I was not born for happiness,
Your grief, would never move my heart,
Would Hymen strew along our way,
Am I unworthy, you would find.
But madden me, spur me to depart.
Habit would cool my love for you.
Wed, the fire would soon have died;
All such is alien to my mind;
Many a night, and many a day?
What thorns, not roses, through the years
Of your perfection too, no less
15.
Cold, darkly threatening, and dour!
(Cursing the hour of his birth),
Her days and nights alone, through life,
A household, a neglected wife,
While the spouse, knowing her worth,
Is ever-jealous, sullen, sour,
What in the world is worse than this,
Mourning her husband's absent kiss,
Is this the destiny that waits,
Such am I. Was it this you sought,
Was this what you hoped to find;
With your pure and ardent mind;
Dealt you by the cruel Fates?
This the message your note brought?
16.
And then...our hearts we must restrain,
So hear me without tears or anger,
A girl will often change her lover,
My love for you is as a brother's,
Spring clothes the branches with new leaves,
Not all will see what your soul weaves,
Fresh dreams will replace the last,
As, after winter's icy blast,
My soul, nothing can renew....
The inexperienced come to grief.
As heaven dictates. You'll love again.
More tender even, but as true:
Know you as I, share your belief:
His days and dreams, what man recovers?
17.
(Mechanically, as they say)
Saw nothing through the tears that glistened,
There such freedoms are allowed,
Entered, together, arm in arm,
Upon it, sadly, Tanya leant,
He gave his arm: downcast, head bent,
As much as in Moscow, the proud.
Blind with that mist that veils the eye.
In that, for rustic life to pardon.
So Eugene preached, as she listened;
Homeward, through the kitchen-garden;
She scarcely breathed; made no reply;
No one finding any harm
And slowly they both made their way
18.
But from our friends, may God preserve us!
(Both are perhaps synonymous)
Oh! Those friends, those friends, so dear,
Never placed him in the right,
Our friend behaved well, in his way,
By both friend and enemy,
Not without cause I hail them here.
Who showed him ambiguous respect.
From foes we can ourselves protect:
Dealt with her sympathetically;
Surely, my Reader, you'd agree
Of nobility of soul; yet spite
Not for the first time, made display
Castigated ruthlessly
19.
He loves you....like your dearest kin!
In decent company, and smile,
Without a hint of hate or guile,
Yet he is yours, through thick and thin,
But in parentheses I'll mention,
That there's no infamy so deep,
Epigram in all its coarseness,
No absurdity, no foulness,
That a friend would not repeat,
Is still to lull dark thoughts to sleep.
Ten times, and never miss a beat;
Nurtured by the mob, no dire
What of it? Well, my true intention
Born, in a garret, of a liar
20.
Ah well, to them may God be kind!
Or to whom we send a card,
At least, denoting our regard,
Then, the year through, we can hide,
Visits to at Christmas-tide,
H'm! My valued Reader, tell me,
You might enjoy it, so allow me,
Whom we are obliged to cherish,
Relations then are those, it seems,
Our face will never cross their mind...
Out clearly what relation means.
Are all your relations well?
Show respect to, love, and relish
For your enlightenment, to spell
21.
Though you're a spouse respected,
Yet the most loyal, it's expected,
In every vicissitude of life,
By your good and virtuous wife,
You may trust through storms above,
Of course, a tender beauty's love,
More sure than that of friends or kin,
Ah, but then the whirl of fashion,
And the waywardness of passion,
Are subject to infatuations,
Opinions they express in town...
Whatever trouble you are in.
The gentle sex is light as down.
Love is a mere game of Satan's.
22.
Estimable Reader: come,
Love yourself, your only care,
Never pursue a phantom,
Whom to love, whom to believe in,
Who will fit their speech and action,
Who will refrain from slander,
Who support us when we wander,
No more deserving lover,
Or more fitting, you'll discover.
Be amused by our vices;
To our measure, in the end?
On whom alone shall we depend?
Who is never bored by us?
Or waste your efforts on the air
23.
Alas, not difficult to guess!
Like lost fading echoes flee,
Poor Tatyana was on fire,
Love's violent pains, heart's beating,
All those torments that oppress,
Health, life's beauty, sweetness past,
Her smile, her calm serenity,
The dawning day in sombre cloud.
Sleep deserted her entire.
Poor Tanya's youth fading fast:
The soul, wreathed in its sadness;
But, the outcome of their meeting?
As a storm will often shroud
Worse, with a joyless madness
24.
She, more pallid, and more silent!
Enough. It's high time that instead,
I painted over this sad scene,
Tatyana's bloom is all but gone,
Nothing can provide distraction,
Whispering solemnly together,
And portrayed love's happiness,
Sighing: 'It's high time she was wed!'...
Or stir her soul, no incitement.
My Tatyana, with all my heart.
I'm overcome, by pity I mean;
Neighbours shook their heads, forever
Though, dear Reader, I confess
Forgive me: I've loved from the start
25.
And her youthful charms, elated,
Timidly, once in a while,
Encouraged by his Olga's smile,
Side by side, in the gloom,
And then? Full of confusion,
Modest, tender, sweet illusion,
Or in the garden, in the dawn,
He'd dare to toy with a tress,
They'd stroll about on the lawn.
Or kiss the hem of her dress.
Surrendered himself completely.
So, Vladimir more captivated
Always together, in her room
Hour by hour, by Olga's beauty
26.
Unsuitable for girls to hear),
Sometimes he read to Olga,
Over a game of chess they pored,
Deep in thought, above the board,
Beside which Chateaubriand's pale,
Some profoundly moral tale,
Till Lensky, with abstracted look,
Or in some corner, an hour or so,
(Fancies, fables of the ages,
Skipping over certain pages,
Silent, leaning on an elbow,
With his pawn took his own rook.
But not without a blush, I fear.
Nature passages of a power
27.
Or on a page some other's signed,
Within, a rural landscape painted,
One with which she's acquainted,
Attention to her album: find,
He leaves a tender verse behind,
That Olga occupies his mind,
From passing thought, enduring rhyme,
Perched on a lyre a little dove,
A tomb, a Cyprian shrine to love,
Lightly sketched, with wash and ink,
That stands impervious to time.
His dream's mute monument, a link
Applies himself with diligent
At home he renders it apparent
28.
On the next page let them write.'
'Qu'�crirez-vous sur ces tablettes?'
Anywhere, start, end, or middle,
Lines too short, long, or a riddle,
You'll often have seen, of course,
Ill-rhymed verse, by tradition,
With friendship's and wisdom's pearls,
Such albums of provincial girls,
'Whoever's love for you's more bright,
A scribbled, and mis-spelt, rendition.
While the last has this reflection:
And on the first page, for inspection:
Above 't(out) � v(ous), Annette';
Which their friends will all endorse
29.
Adding to albums of that kind,
Two hearts, some flowers, a torch assure,
Some army type too will have written,
Will not be picked apart again,
By critics of the higher arts,
Grateful, in my heart of hearts,
And there you'll see, without a doubt,
Who'll solemnly consider it,
With many a solemn vow round about,
An ironic stanza of how he's smitten.
And argue whether it shows wit.
How love to the tomb will endure;
I must confess I scarcely mind
The eager nonsense I may pen
30.
Though she requires a madrigal!
May Heaven's lightning wither you!
But you, the suspect volumes bound,
In secret regions underground,
That stirs dark epigrams within me,
Prompting something steeped in gall,
With lines by Baratynsky too,
Offers me her own, in quarto,
To torment fashionable rhymesters,
The rage and spite she cannot know,
Abodes of demons and of monsters;
By Fyodor Tolstoy, decorated
You handsome albums, illustrated
When a fashionable lady
31.
The noble elegies you've sired,
Into Olga's album here,
Will at some far distant date,
Full of life's sincerest passions,
God knows whom and what; your art,
Tell the story of your fate.
Sparkles of icy wit appear.
His tributes, carefully, he fashions.
All he sees and hears, he notes;
To Olga, his hours he devotes;
So Yazykov, when you're inspired
His lines breathe love alone, and no
Singing, from your burning heart
No madrigals from Lensky flow
32.
Enough, it's time now to move on!'
The wretched wreath of elegy (sic),
Commands us to reject for good,
To our poetic brotherhood,
And recreate the magic hoard,
The classic mask, the trumpet, sword,
This perpetual sterile talking,
Cries: 'Cease your endless squawking,
Must write true odes, odes gentlemen,
That's it, my friend?' - 'No! Your pen,
- 'You're right, and so you'd show us,
Through our work, of lost genius:
Lamenting what is done and gone;
But hush! You hear? Our sternest critic
33.
'- Only the solemn choral ode!
As they composed them long ago...'
All of that ancient rhetoric,
As in the olden days they flowed,
Challenge that, but here's the thing,
'Ah, but the elegy's so light,
Enough, it's all the same, you know,
So thin, and sparse, and so empty,
Better than one dour modern lyric?' -
I'd not set the ages quarrelling.
In his deft satire: Is all you've read
Remember what Dimitriev said
Treads the skies.' Well now, I might
The ode shows pure nobility
34.
While she gazes at the cover!
With tumult in his heart and head,
In love with fame, by freedom bitten,
What odes might Vladimir have written,
Who reads the works of his creation,
To the object of his adoration,
Which Olga never would have read.
Be more amused by something light.
Than that for poet, day or night.
For his love, his latest verses?
How blessed is the modern lover
Is there a poet who rehearses
They say there's no sweeter delight
Blessed is he...although she might
35.
Or else (all joking aside)
Exhausted by regret, and rhyme,
To products of my inspiration,
The fruits of my own meditation,
I'll seize a neighbour by the collar,
Or after a long tedious dinner,
And choke him with a tragedy,
Who's dropped by accidentally,
Rise from the shore, and soar away.
The indulgence of a childhood friend;
I read to my old nurse, who'll lend
Of my verse by the water's side
By the lake I'll walk, the chime
Startling the wild ducks till they
36-37.
But, what of Onegin? True, dear Reader!
His daily round I'll describe here,
Your forbearance now I'll crave,
Then take his way, despite the chill,
Like a hermit in his heaven,
Of wisdom, then for coffee rings,
Like Byron, who of Gulnare sings,
Then sips the news from some vile font,
He swims that little Hellespont,
Second stroll, and then et cetera...
For your pleasure, so be brave.
To the stream below the hill.
On summer morns, he'll rise at seven;
And then he'll dress, may write a letter, a
38-39
Gave himself to it instead,
Forgetting friends and city life,
A bottle of sparkling wine,
A light dinner, not too pensive,
A lively horse and responsive,
Shadowy woods and crystal brook,
A book, a walk, sleep that's deep,
Ceased to count the summer days,
He gently yielded to its ways,
And cloistered life Onegin led.
And tiresome pleasures full of strife.
The heart alive with kiss and look;
Peace and quiet - such the fine
A dark-eyed, white-skinned maid to keep
40.
The sky with autumn's breath is clouded,
But summer in our northern clime,
And, mist on meadows everywhere,
A parody of southern winter,
Of wild geese, in noisy clans,
Shorter and shorter grow the days,
Sad rustling fills the woodland ways,
A tedious season we await,
Who find November at the gate.
Though we'd deny its flight, is over.
More often now the sun is shrouded;
With all their mysteries laid bare;
Flashes by, and in no time
Southward stretch the caravans
41.
The hand no longer drives the cattle,
To the spinning-wheel's low rattle,
Dawn breaks in a chilly gloom,
The wary traveller first shivers,
Her work the crackling firewood lights,
Abandoned, the fields are silent,
Nor calls them to their pen at noon.
The faithful friend of wintry nights.
Then dashes off uphill, in flight.
On the highway, snorts and quivers;
And hungry wolves, that loom
Indoors the maid will softly croon
Now from the shed at morning light
From the fog, the horse can scent
42.
Take it then, since you're so eager!)
Extends, and tries the gleaming ice,
Slithers, and slips, in a trice,
Frost already, frozen noses,
The merry lads cut with their skates,
The ice that paves the hidden streams,
Meadows silver, sunlight meagre...
Toying happily with the Fates.
Stars the frozen shores below.
(My Reader thinks the rhyme is roses:
Slides to rest, her fall complete;
Brighter than finest parquet gleams
A great fat goose her red-webbed feet
Glittering, the first winter snow
43.
Sliding on ice, with his worn shoe,
Accounts, drink, rage, the gloomy evening,
Goes somehow, tomorrow too,
Be careful of your horses step,
It's as monotonous as home.
Triumphant you'll see winter through.
Down he'll slip, and throw you too.
There's Dominique de Pradt, or Scott.
Is bare, inevitably bores, the reason:
Go riding on the empty steppe?
Spend the time indoors, reading?
What can one do in such a season?
You don't care for them a lot?
Walk? The countryside you roam
44.
Now at last, it's time to dine!
Beside the fire a table's laid,
The cue's abandoned, half-lights fade,
His three roans in a troika. Fine,
With icy baths his days begin,
From dawn, his only occupation,
To strike a billiard-ball or two,
Then as the rural evening nears,
He waits then Lensky appears,
At home all day, more or less,
Yields to pensive idleness,
Not more, with an old blunt cue;
Alone, engrossed in calculation;
A true Childe Harold, my Onegin
45.
Verses, quarrels: ah, what dreams!
(Likenesses too, of this and that)
How many follies in its presence,
The heavenly drink, you'd agree,
Once, it's golden bubbles seen,
What laughter from enchanted streams,
Bottles of Cliquot or Mo�t,
In chilled bottles, for the poet,
Reaches the table, speedily,
It sparkles, like the Hippocrene.
Captivated by its essence;
To imbibe it, friends: recall?
Cheerfully, I'd give my all
Enchanted me: I often sat
46.
Here's to my dear friend, Bordeaux!
Always faithful to the end,
To Champagne I'm no longer true,
Yet to my stomach it's a traitor,
Champagne is like a mistress,
Sparkling, lively, and capricious,
Ready to serve, today, tomorrow,
In misfortune, and in sorrow,
Wilful, wild, but empty too...
That's my favourite, nowadays.
Bordeaux, I tell the waiter:
With its hissing, foaming ways;
But you, Bordeaux, are a friend
Joy of our hours of leisure, so
47.
As being entre chien et loup,'
Though why, I can hardly tell.)
Of smoke scarce visible, soft, pale,
I love a friendly glass, the same,
(I love such conversation too,
The hearth glows, pipe-smoke passes,
On the table, bubble, hiss,
Then settle like the evening mist...
Our friends now are in its spell.
Spirals upwards, overhead;
The golden coals, a slender thread
Around the hour the French name
The fire dies down; the ashes veil
Up through the flue, sparkling glasses
48.
Her neck, her throat, her shoulder!
Like the fool I am, I clean forgot!
Your Olga, how's Tatyana too?'
Besides, my friend, you're invited,
What spirit too! Before we're older,
'How is she then, your fair neighbour,
Olga's turned into, so lovely,
You must go, no matter what.' -
- 'Just a little more, a flavour...
You must go, they'd be delighted.
Never once called on them again:
You visited them twice, and then
Fine...They're all well, and send you
Their greetings, ah, what a beauty
49.
Talks of Olga: such is love!
- No, nobody, assuredly!
And the crowd, all the rabble...'
'Oh there'll be no end of babble,
Drains his glass then, Heavens above,
Olga and her mother ask you,
To join them, it's next Saturday,
Toasting his fair neighbour, Lensky,
Who'll be there? Just the family,
What do you say?' - 'Alright!' - 'Bravo!' -
There's no reason for you not to.' -
Oblige me. Tell me that you'll go.
'I must?' - 'Yes: for Tanya's birthday.
50.
The secrets of the marriage bed,
Lensky is overjoyed, elated,
Love's sweet crown so long awaited,
Scene after dull, exhausting scene,
Take domesticity to mean,
All the trouble, and the pain,
Forgetting Hymen's gifts, vexation,
While we, of Hymen's charms the foes,
My poor Lensky, from the heart,
Such stuff as Lafontaine's suppose...
His wedding two scant weeks ahead.
Cold yawns with their icy train.
Was made for this very part.
He dreams of, in his exultation:
51.
Motivation, action, speech,
Yet wretched the man who foresees all,
Whose heart, experienced, grown chill,
Rests, on the fantasy within,
Blessed, the man who lives a fiction,
He was loved...such his conviction,
And calms his fears with a kiss,
No longer forgets itself, at will.
Never doubting, lived in bliss.
Is hateful, in its essence, gall;
Like a drunken traveller at an inn;
Sipping the hour as it slips by;
The sober-headed, for whom each
Or, less harshly, like a butterfly
Chapter Five
Oh, be spared these fearful dreams,
Thou, my Svetlana.
Zhukovsky
1.
That year, the autumn lingered,
And waking early, Tanya found,
A wintry carpet deep and light,
Till January the third, at night,
Silently: the dawn was bright,
All around her, glittering white.
In yards and fields, loath to go.
A whiteness covering the ground:
Garden, roofs, and fences, pale;
Frosted glass; and far hills gleaming;
Magpies in the courtyard screaming;
Woods cloaked with a silver veil;
Nature waited, icy-fingered
Winter stalled its fall of snow
2.
Powdery furrows as they race,
The best dog, Dasher: he's the horse,
His fingers frostbitten of course,
He trots, performs amazing feats,
His mare snorts at the snowy light,
Mother scolds him from the window.
Makes a fresh road with his sleigh;
In sheepskin coats with scarlet sash;
Steps delicately on her way;
The swift kibitkas' runners trace
It's fun, despite the pain he's in, though
Their coachmen, seated, wield the lash
On his sledge the yard-boy seats
Winter! ...The peasant with delight
3.
With purer inspiration fired,
Prince Vyazemsky, Muse-inspired,
Gives us the first snow's measure,
You may consider unattractive,
Gentle Reader: low and mean,
Charms us with sublime invention,
The delights of frosty days,
Fine verses on his Finnish Maid.
Nature's vulgar, over-active.
All the shades of wintry pleasure;
Secret rendezvous in sleighs;
Nor Baratynsky, who has made
But, perhaps this winter scene
To challenge him I've no intention
4.
Herself not certain of the reason)
To what their mistresses were fated,
Epiphany they celebrated,
In the silent misty evening,
Tatyana (Russian through and through,
Promising, each year, again,
Loved that cold perfection too,
The gleaming radiance on snow,
A soldier-husband, a campaign.
Pink softness of its sunset glow.
Sledge rides; and the far-off haze;
Loved Russia in the winter season;
The glittering frost on shiny days;
In the old way, maids foretelling
5.
That washed its face, and purred,
Of guests arriving brought the word,
The crescent moon, at her left side,
Tanya believed in every tale,
Warning her of this and that,
All objects spoke mysteriously,
From the stove on which it sat.
At the moon's meaning, each chill phase;
The simple lore of bygone days;
Trembled at omens, anxiously;
And then, if suddenly she spied
What dreams or cards portend, grew pale
Strange presentiments: even the cat
6.
And hurriedly, before it died,
If she met, all unaware,
Watching its flight with anxious eye,
Leaving a shining trail, she'd shiver,
Crossed her path, in panicked flight,
In her confusion she'd take fright,
And when a meteor crossed the sky,
Left her uncertain what to do...
Her secret wish to it confide.
For some malignant blow of fate.
Her face grew pale, and she'd quiver.
A black-cowled monk, or if a hare
And fled through the fields, that too
With sad expectancy would wait
7.
Melds fascination with alarm)
Christmas comes, joys unfold,
(Since, fond of contradiction, Nature,
Knowing all our joy is mortal,
Its fate in death's gaping portal,
Yet she found a secret charm,
For careless youth's without regret,
And life's horizons broad as yet,
Even in the midst of terror.
Beguiles, with its seductive lies.
And life a transient mystery:
The fortunes of the young are told;
While age, in spectacles, can see
No matter, hope in childish guise
8.
We sing those who, fortunes made,
Shovelling silver with a spade,
Watching the molten wax assume,
Lifted from the water, shaken,
Then from a dish, rings are taken,
Shapes where her own imagination,
While the girls recite old rhymes,
'Peasants there in riches wallow,
Girls prefer The Kitten's Wedding.
Is where that fair song is heading:
As for Tanya this one chimes:
Finds delight to come, or doom;
Now Tanya stares in fascination
Live in glory...ah, but sorrow
9.
She rushes to him, on tiptoe,
'What is your name?' He moves on,
A frosty night: the sky is clear,
Tatyana the pale garden gains,
The glittering stars, their endless trains,
Nothing from that darkened glass,
Her voice tender, sweet and low,
His rustic answer: 'Agafon'.
Move in their harmonious sphere...
Seeing its sad face tremble, pass...
Like a reed-pipe, pure, her sigh:
The crunch of snow...someone goes by;
A mirror on the moon, but learns
And, heedless of the cold, she turns
10.
But she takes fright, my Tatyana,
Tatyana takes herself to bed,
Instead we see, her sash untied,
Taking her nurse's fond advice,
I too recall....ah, not for me,
A mirror underneath the pillow,
This fortune-telling, I'll let be.
Tanya sleeps, at peace below.
A table's readied for the pair;
While Zhukovsky's Svetlana
The love-god, Lel, overhead
And in the bath-house, in a trice
Hovers, still these girls will hide
For fortune-telling they prepare
11.
Two slender boughs glued by ice,
A delicate and trembling ridge,
Stretched across to form a bridge,
Hidden from the world: while pale,
Into the shadows, still the same,
And in deep perplexity,
There she stands, helplessly.
To make a passer-by think twice:
But wonders come to her in dreams:
A thing the winter cannot tame;
She wanders through a snowy vale
Wrapped in mist and gloom, it seems
Among the snowdrifts, roars
A seething torrent, foaming, pours
12.
She's followed closely by the bear!
Lets him draw her to dry land,
She stumbles on - and yet, beware,
No one is there, beyond its seething,
As if before some mournful parting,
A snowdrift shifts, a shaggy bear,
Tatyana screams! ...She hears a roar,
Rises from his hidden lair,
He offers her a long curved claw,
Along the fragile bridge's length.
To lead her to the other side;
She sorrows at the dark divide;
And putting out a trembling hand
To help her cross, she gathers strength
13.
She dare not stop, or look behind,
There's no escape, in her sad mind,
She quickens her despairing pace,
Birch, and lime, and aspen bare,
Their branches, as she stumbles on,
All the world seems lost in sleep,
Meet the sky in sombre lines,
She plunges on, he grunts and follows,
Drowned in snow, and buried deep.
From that dark forbidding face;
With starlit crowns; the track is gone;
Far into the silent hollows;
Heaped with snow; glittering there
Here's a wood: in beauty, pines
14.
She runs, he follows, on and on,
She dare not, in her shame and fear,
A branch leans down to snag her hair,
No time to retrieve it, in her fright,
Until her strength is all but gone.
The soft snow reaches to her knee;
Her handkerchief is next to go;
Through the wood she flees the bear;
The creature once again is near;
Pluck the gold earrings from her ears;
Lift her trailing hem, in flight;
Covered by the powdery snow;
And then one wet shoe disappears
And scratch her neck, and stubbornly
15.
The bear speaks: 'Friends live here,
Come in, warm yourself, my dear,
He pushes through the open door,
Here's a hut, to which he dashes,
Now along the track he crashes,
His sharp claws, she lies inert,
One window yields a rosy glow,
Trees crowd round; it's drowned in snow,
And sets her down upon the floor.
Ignore the tumult and the chatter';
In his grasp, and barely breathing;
From inside there's noise and clatter;
Rushes to lift her, swiftly sheathing
She falls to the snow, the bear alert
16.
Seems half a heron, half a cat!
A monstrous crew, imagine it!
She recovers, gazes round,
Behind a door cheers resound,
The clamour of a wake; unsure,
She finds a spy-hole in the door,
A dwarf who sports a tail; and that,
One has a horned and doglike face;
A skeleton haughtily in place;
A frightful witch with a goatee;
The bear has gone; she's in a hall;
One a cockerel's head; and see
Cries, the clash of glasses, all
And, there? .....Around a table sit
17.
Horses' hooves and human speech!
Mounts a goose's neck, a skull!
A windmill dances a wild jig,
Bark, laugh, whistle, sing and screech,
Then in the crowd inside that hovel,
Sits a crayfish; wonderful,
Onegin drinks amidst the roar,
Our poor Tatyana recognises,
The one she fears and idolises -
Glancing stealthily at the door.
Its sails a creaking whirligig;
Who but the hero of our novel?
And stranger still, behold a spider
In red night-cap, a second rider
18.
And curious as young girls are,
It's plain that he's the master here,
He drinks - the creatures howl and swill,
Tanya recovers from her fear,
Among them all, confusion reigns,
He laughs - and they all fall about,
Pushes the door till it's ajar...
All rise; he rushes to the door.
He frowns - and everyone is still;
Clatters his chair against the floor;
Agitates the candle-flames;
He nods - and there's a mighty shout;
With glittering eyes Onegin there
But suddenly a draught of air
19.
To cry aloud: 'She's mine, she's mine!'
Turn to her; and every guise,
To flee the place; She cannot move,
Of raucous laughter swell; all eyes,
Of horn and hoof and crooked snout,
Fang and tusk and blood-stained jaw,
Beard, tufted tail, sharp gleaming claw,
The greater her attempts to fly,
The less of use her efforts prove.
And bony finger, point her out;
And all their voices now combine
Her to that hellish crew - and peals
Eugene flings wide the door, reveals
Filled with terror, see her try
20.
When suddenly they're visited,
To a frail bed in a corner, there,
Light flashes; Eugene lifts his arm,
The wild host vanishes from sight,
'Mine', Yevgeny's voice rings out,
Against intruders; furiously,
Tanya lies there, cold as death.
Alone together, at his shout.
By Olga and her lover Lensky.
On her shoulder leans his head;
Contests their entry in a breath;
As if to raise a magic charm
Onegin quietly carries her
And leaves them in the gloomy light
21.
And Tanya, full of terror, wakes...!
Whom did your dream reveal to you?'
Then Lensky falls, robbed of life,
Yevgeny swiftly grasps a knife,
The door flies open, Olga's there,
She lights the North: 'Now, tell me true,
Louder and louder grows the quarrel,
The dawn is breaking, crimson, bright,
Scream rings out...the cabin shakes...
She gazes round; the room grows light;
The shadows thicken, till a dreadful
Through the frosted glass, and then
And rosy as Aurora when
Light as a swallow, and as fair
22.
Enthral like Martin Zadeka,
Diviner, and Chaldean sage,
To yield poetic inspiration,
Compelling truth, or illustration,
But Tanya, seeming not to hear,
Virgil, Byron, Walter Scott,
Reader of dreams to the age.
Turns its leaves, no word or tear;
Though Racine, or Seneca
Yet the book has no pretension
Seizes a book, with rapt attention
Even the fashion page, could not
23.
Along with Cottin's work Malvina,
In every sorrow that she had,
Dog-eared, with the cover bare,
Though in exchange he took as well,
(Our dear Lomonosov), a grammar,
This deep and learned opus to her,
The price three-fifty for the pair,
He was her solace and delight,
Sharing her pillow every night.
Fables: Zadeka though was better;
Volume Three of Marmontel
(Those Memoirs), and two Petriads
A prize which Tatyana bought
A wandering pedlar had brought
24.
A clue the index may afford her,
Her dream is deeply worrying her,
She makes him her interpreter,
Not knowing what it signifies,
Martin Zedeka can't allay,
Her nightmare seeming to portray,
Seeking its meaning from the wise.
Endless future tribulation.
Snout, snow, storm, warlock, and the rest.
Is troubled by its mystery.
Laid out in alphabetic order:
For several days thereafter she
But her mounting trepidation
Bear, bridge, darkness, fir and forest
25.
And clog the Larin's steps and drive,
As neighbouring families arrive,
The hall is crowded, shoving, pushing,
The new-born sun, the day is dawning,
Guests bow politely at the door,
With coaches, carriages and britzkas,
The parlour's full of unknown faces,
Lap dogs yapping, airs and graces,
Tanya's birthday, filled with greetings,
Young girls kissing, noise and crushing.
While nurses screech, and infants roar.
Calashes, broughams, and kibitkas.
But now, from out the vales of morning
Aurora, rosy-fingered, brings
26.
In peaked cap, hair full of fluff,
And here's Gvozdin, squire and farmer,
Here, with his wife, a portly charmer,
Pustyakov the plump arrives,
And the ex-councillor Flyanov,
Then my 'cousin', Buyanov,
The Skotinins, turning grey,
Glutton, bribe-taker, and prankster.
Inveterate gossip, old-time gangster:
(You know the fellow, right enough);
Whose serfs live miserable lives;
Petushkov next, the local beau;
From two to thirty, in a row;
With children of all ages, say
27.
Substituting - belle Tatiana!
With his offspring on display)
Boldly replacing its belle Nina,
For Tanya, a song that children sing,
To rescue it, as is his custom,
Triquet, ingenious poet, dares,
In a red peruke and glasses,
(With Panil Kharlikov, who passes,
Printed among the ancient airs,
The Tambov wit, Monsieur Triquet,
R�veillez-vous, belle endormie.
With a familiar melody:
Always the Frenchman, had to bring
He found it in some dusty album
28.
The colonel's sent them, so, a dance!
From the local camp, what rapture!
They cross themselves, grace is repeated,
The young girls dream, in a trance,
Lo, the company commander,
But dinner's served, the couples pair,
He enters...ah, what news, hurray,
The band will come: they're on their way,
Then a buzz, while all are seated.
Ones whose Mamas plot his capture.
Tanya's the centre of all this.
Anticipating future bliss.
Go, arm in arm to table, where
The girls' true idol, at least the older
29.
While they chew. All around,
No one listens, they just speak,
Guests squeeze up to let them in,
Lensky's here, and with Onegin,
There's a lull in conversation,
Plates, dishes chime, in unison,
The room is loud and growing louder,
Places set, each finds a chair,
The door swings open, wide it flies,
'Ah, at last!' their hostess cries,
With the glasses' clinking sound.
Hoot or argue, shout or shriek.
And, smiling, room's made for the pair.
All the noise of talk and laughter;
30.
They sit across from our Tatyana,
Ready to faint, alas, poor thing,
Revive. Two words, a whispering,
Overwhelmed, near suffocating,
With passion's fire she is blazing,
She shivers as if she were ill,
But now her reason and her will,
She's paler than the moon at dawn,
Lowered eyes grown clouded, darker,
The two friends' greeting scarcely hears,
To greet them, and to hold her nerve.
Trembling like a hunted fawn.
While her eyes are drowned in tears.
Forced between her lips, will serve
31.
Repay him: and with joyful stare,
His friend for his own presence there,
He saw the poor girl's quivering state,
To rouse his friend to indignation,
And swore in deepening irritation,
Had long bored Eugene to distraction,
Hysteria, fainting, tragic tears,
An awkward guest at such a feast,
Not one to savour it in the least,
Of every guest there, in his mind.
Experienced but the one reaction.
He hated girls' neurotic fears;
A caricature he next designed
He dropped his gaze, began to hate
32.
You've intoxicated me in style!
Like yours my darling, made to hold,
Alas, excessive) and the wine,
Smoky bottles, tarred with twine,
Ever Love's most alluring vial,
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
But all eyes were turned, I own,
On a rich pie (its saltiness,
In noting Tanya's distress,
To separate blancmange from roast,
And glasses, tall, with narrow waist,
Object of my verses chaste:
A Tsimlyansky, for a toast;
Our Yevgeny was not alone
33.
Always partly out of tune,
To pride; he's first to drink her health,
Fizzing, and amidst the talk,
Freed now of its dampened cork,
As verse inside him burns and glows,
Tatyana feels half-dead; Triquet,
Present his song-sheet, wish her wealth.
Is forced to curtsey to his bow.
Triquet rises, with noble gaze;
The noise subsides, and faces glaze;
Though great, our poet is immune
A bottle pops; the wine now flows
To cheers, applause. Tanya now
Turns, page in hand then sings away
34.
Yet revealing in his glance,
Then he bowed to her, in silence,
Her distress, her hidden passion,
His expression quite sincerely,
Eugene stood there uneasily,
Wishes, good health, felicity,
A meaning that her heart obeyed.
Noting the pallor in her face.
Stirred a flicker of compassion.
Tanya replied to each with grace;
Half-jesting, or with true intent;
Or played a part unwittingly;
His tender look still conveyed
A tenderness. Whether he meant
35.
For Boston, claiming the old-fashioned,
Those keenest to take part are summoned,
The green card-tables are in place,
Or whist, that's never out of grace,
The chairs scrape backwards on the floor,
But they're replete from their labour,
That's sired by boredom out of greed.
Into the meadows, in full bloom.
Neighbour wheezes now at neighbour.
The ladies sit beside the fire;
The whispering girls elsewhere conspire;
For all of that monotonous breed
They crowd into the drawing room
Like bees that leave the hive, and pour
36.
Your three thousand year diploma!
Will often food and drink rehearse,
And I'll mention here, in passing,
Popping corks, and idle feasting,
That helped you earn, divine Homer,
In this countryside of ours,
Of clock or watch I count the hours,
Changed places: there, you have the gist,
Our stomachs - prompt horology.
But by breakfast, dinner, tea;
That the substance of my verse
Then tea arrives. Not by the chimes
Have played a rubber; and eight times
Eight times our heroes at their whist
37-9
Lensky, Tanya's; Kharlikova,
Their steaming cups, have barely stirred,
Leaving his tea and rum aground,
Diverted by the welcome sound,
The crowd spills into the hall,
Petushkov, neighbourhood Adonis,
Tea, then: the girls take up, demurely,
When in the doorway, loudly, sweetly,
Flute, bassoon, are gladly heard.
And all is brilliance at the ball.
Off, in haste, with Pustyakova;
Seeks Olga's lovely hand in his;
Triquet; Buyanov then steps
Maid of riper years, accepts
40.
I thought I'd paint (See Chapter One)
In your traces: now youth's done,
And as it ends, with this confession,
No more of error and distraction,
Now, no more, of ifs and maybes,
A Petersburg ball, in all its glory,
Free Chapter Five from more digression.
To little feet, entrancing ladies.
Yet as Albani might have done;
Now I must take to sounder reasoning;
No more, dear feet, of wandering
But empty fancy's vain distraction
Reminded me of my attraction
At the commencement of my story
41.
Now is the moment of revenge,
Then they're off again in style,
All are watching in surprise,
His hand to Olga, leads the girl,
Next they sit, and talk politely,
As giddy youth, the dancers fly,
Lensky can't believe his eyes.
Speak of this and that a while;
Among the guests; they swiftly twirl;
Couples sweeping wildly by;
For the waltz, and stepping lightly;
Onegin smiles as he extends
Now, while predictable and mindless
Wheeling in its circles, tireless
42.
Heels, and leaps, and long moustache,
Enough to make the ballroom shake,
At the mazurka, floors would quake,
As some old squire cuts a dash,
A sight of the true original,
No sign of the fevered tyrant, Fashion,
Now, the mazurka. Long ago,
Glide smoothly over lacquered boards,
Not now: we like more polished games,
Heels pounding on the wood below,
That plague of every modern Russian.
The windows rattle in their frames.
All still the same as we recall;
Though a provincial town affords
43-44.
Both the sisters, by the hand,
He waits till the mazurka's done,
Her, while to her ear confiding,
Achieved in her conceited look,
Some subtle whispered compliment,
A moment: that was all it took.
And then demands the cotillion.
The dance to Olga, as he'd planned;
Stares, grows mad with jealousy;
He dances, nonchalantly guiding
To our hero, who concedes
Presses her hand - his whole intent
Flushed and satisfied. Poor Lensky
Buyanov, my lively 'cousin' leadz
45.
To Onegin. Dear God in heaven!
Know all love's treacherous devicez!
Exits, calls loudly for his horse,
He curses woman's reckless course,
Left the cradle, play flirt, coquette,
Rides off. A pair of pistols though,
Possess that cunning, share those vices,
The hour that must decide his fate.
Poor Lensky's reeling from the blow.
What's this he's hearing? Can it be...?
She can't. And why? Because she's given
Can this girl who's scarcely yet
Two bullets - nothing else - await
Her word away, she's pledged already
Chapter Six
Nasce una gente a cui l'morir none dole.
Petrarch
      L� sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi
      There, where days are cloudy and brief,
Are born a people to whom death brings no pain.
1.
In attic too. Eugene, instead,
Was bored again beyond all measure,
From the ground floor to the upper,
At last it's over, now it's supper,
Eugene, now Vladimir had left,
All glad at heart to take their rest,
Then rooms are found for every guest,
Glancing round to seek her Lensky,
Drives home, preferring his own bed.
This nightmare whirling, on and on.
Entirely of his vengeful pleasure;
Tired of this cotillion;
By Olga, though yet not bereft
Olga too yawns by him, sadly
2.
The girls are stowed with Tatyana,
Alone and sad, my darling Tanya,
But, lighted by Diana's gleam,
Triquet's slumbering on the floor,
And Flyanov, toss and turn on chairs,
Snore for snore, fat Pustyakov,
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,
By his better half is lying.
At dark fields, mirroring her cares.
And with Olga, lost in dream;
In shirt and night-cap, by the door;
In the dining room downstairs;
All's peaceful; in the parlour, vying
Sleepless, at the window, stares
3.
Though he can't bring me happiness.'
And jealousy, you understand,
Strength to complain, I confess,
Her failure too to comprehend;
Onegin's unexpected presence;
His fleeting glance of tenderness;
To make of that; her own distress;
As if a cold, an icy hand
His partnering Olga too, what sense
He brings' - she murmurs - 'and I lack
Had gripped her heart, as if a black
All pierced her to the core; and then
And seething abyss at her feet
Had opened... 'Yet the death is sweet
4.
So our age improves us creatures!
But on, on with my story!
Kind and sober, now, instead,
Zaretsky, once a reprobate,
Five versts from Krasnogorye,
Lensky's estate, worth a mention,
He, as friend in need, you'll gather,
There lives, and thrives no less,
In the intellectual wilderness,
A new face claims our attention.
Even as man of honour, features:
Father of many, still unwed;
And sage of inns, a philanderer;
Gambler-in-chief, an intimate
5.
As long as, on credit, they'd guarantee,
For capture again, should that arise,
Drunk as an owl, a Frenchman's prize,
Carried away by his brave calling,
When far ahead of his battalion,
He toppled from his Kalmuck stallion,
An ace of clubs at twenty paces,
Of honour: ready - it was his goal -
And pierce the very heart of it.
Three bottles a day, for him, chez V�ry.
He made his name by simply falling:
Yet a modern Regulus, the soul
There was a time when envious faces
Praised his sheer daring; he could hit
6.
And end, himself, in the mire,
He liked debate, to point a moral,
Cunningly begin a quarrel,
As much the victim of his fun,
Incite two friends of his to fight,
A duel in the morning light,
Make a blunt or sharp retort,
Prone to lead a fool about,
As any passing simpleton.
By the nose; deceive the clever;
In secret, or with raucous shout;
Though he'd occasionally misfire
He was the practical joker, ever
At times be silent, then in sport
7.
With cruel joke, or lying oath!
(Like love's young dream, another jest)
Or force them to be reconciled,
Though privately they'd be reviled,
For my Zaretsky, as I said,
Found refuge from the storm of life,
Plants cabbages, and free from strife,
Beneath his cherries and acacias,
Like Horace, peaceful and sagacious,
Sed alia tempora! With the rest,
The children learn their ABC.
Such things belong to youth, now dead.
And earn a luncheon with them both;
Breeds ducks and geese, while at his knee
8.
The visit, a note he proffered,
But for his wit, which he rated,
Onegin, without more ado,
At the window, read it through.
When Zaretsky met his eyes.
Finding him sensible, yet smart.
The missive gave a caustic grin:
He'd called, was pleasant company;
Penned by Lensky, and as he offered
He was no fool; appreciated
So morning brought no great surprise
Yet, after brief greeting, to begin
By Yevgeny not for his heart
In the past quite frequently
9.
What might result: 'Ever prepared.'
And spoke as if he scarcely cared,
Yet left Eugene, alone, dismayed,
At this Zaretsky promptly rose,
Onegin without hesitating,
Turned to the envoy, mutely waiting,
Politely, without indecision,
Lensky, coolly, with precision,
In as brief a cartel as was right,
Not needing to prolong his stay,
Now anxious to be on his way,
Unhappy with the role he'd played.
Had merely challenged him to fight.
And brought the visit to a close;
10.
Go seeking quarrels, take offence,
And played a wholly different role,
Second: the poet might be a fool,
Yevgeny should have shown control,
In private judgement on his action,
While, holding him in such affection,
Not, blown in every direction,
To a love both shy and tender,
Not as a man of honour, sense.
He condemned himself severely:
But then at eighteen that's the rule;
Mocked what true hearts engender;
First: he'd erred in his reaction
And rightly so: For sitting sternly
11.
Opinion, keeps the whole world turning!
And then such things are like a cancer!
Will slyly whisper, grinning fools...'
For it's our idol, honour's mainspring,
Since that old duellist is vicious,
Instead of bristling from the start,
Besides' - he thought - 'the die is cast,
He might have spoken openly,
'But now, too late: the moment's past...
To Lensky's young, receptive heart.
A trouble-maker, and malicious;
True, contempt should rightly answer
All spiteful gossip, yet his tools
Endeared himself more readily
12.
Now jealousy shows its delight!
At home, impatient, breathing fire,
Here comes Zaretsky, colour higher,
Doubt is over, they will fight,
Beside the mill, and at first light,
By slight of hand, or by some jest,
As soon as daybreak will allow,
From the avenging bullet; now,
Cock their pistols, and let fly,
With solemn look, and sparkling eye.
To hit the head, or break a thigh.
The poet awaits Eugene's reply:
He'd feared lest his opponent might
Make an escape, shield his breast
13.
Checked the sun, his watch - and went!
At the unexpected move he'd made,
Resolved to hate the false, the fickle,
Keen to avoid her, before the duel,
Swiftly, she flew to meet him,
Light as air, ran to greet him,
Abandoning all true discretion,
But no! - Down the steps, as ever,
Lensky, blazing with resentment,
As she might on any other day.
Olga he thought would be dismayed;
He rode in his lover's direction;
Buoyant as hope, that soars forever;
In the same lively, carefree way
14.
Asks him, 'yesterday? Disturbed,
At once he's tortured by remorse,
Faced with her open, tender gaze,
Jealousy gone, and anger's blaze,
He sees, his heart filled with emotion,
Silent, he bows his head before her,
Faced with her sweet simplicity,
Faced with her soul's bright clarity! ...
In confusion, thoughts perturbed.
His happiness rare, and absolute.
To be forgiven; trembles; mute;
'Why did you leave so early,' Olga
Sees he is loved, feels the force
Of pure regret, his only notion
15-17.
Shall not fade before its term.'
'Yet', he reflects, 'I must save her',
To speak about the night before,
Or to examine her at length,
Not allow that coarse seducer,
Shall not attack the lily flower,
The bud of life's fairest hour,
To tempt her with his base desire.
To see Onegin dead, my friends.
But broods on what he must ignore:
With sighs or flattery, to aspire
Now full of grief he lacks the strength
The vile and venomous worm
Which translates as: he intends
18.
Burned in my dear Tanya's heart!
Perhaps her nurse, if she'd been blessed,
Them both, but no one knew her mind,
Aware that Lensky and Eugene,
Onegin was silent, in his fashion,
No one had divined her passion,
The future by some magic art,
To dispute the entrance to the grave -
With quicker wits, might have guessed.
And Tanya alone, in secret, pined;
Had Tanya had the power to see
Love might have found a way to save
Would meet in the morning, keen
If he had known what agony
19.
She gazes earnestly: 'What's wrong?'
As servants of the Muse have acted,
All evening Lensky was distracted,
His seat at the clavichord,
Then play a note or two before,
His leave, his heart crushed, once more,
It seems to him that it must break,
He turns to go, and at the door,
'Nothing,' he answers, and is gone.
'I'm happy, am I not?' he'd whisper.
Now cheerful, now full of gloom;
Turning his troubled gaze on Olga
It's late; and time for him to take
Since time began; so, he'd resume
20.
Like that by Delvig's muse created,
He undresses; a book's selected,
Vladimir shuts the book once more,
Then poetry flows from his pen,
Verse sounds, as he strides the floor,
His sad heart prevents all rest,
At dinner, when intoxicated.
Schiller, to scan by candlelight.
In all her beauty, in the night.
By a single thought oppressed:
Then replaced, their case shut tight;
At home, his pistols are inspected
Full of love's foolishness, again
He seems to see his Olga, bright
21.
Blessed the tomb's darkness there.'
'Where, oh where have you vanished,
By chance, I have the lines, unfinished,
Blessed the day of toil and care,
Sleep and waking have their hour,
Of its arrow, or death wings by,
All is well: our moments fly,
No matter: a just fate awaits me.
That's veiled in deepest mystery.
They're here before me, his in truth:
This day to come, what will it bring?
Golden springtime of my youth?
My eyes in vain seek out the thing
Whether I fall struck by the power
22.
Come to me, come: yours, to the end!...'
Over my urn, and think: "He loved,
Friend of my heart, eternal friend,
All the sad morning of his life,
And in the fierce storm and strife,
Of the poet, this world forget me,
Then the shining day will dawn,
But you, the beautiful, and dear,
And I - perhaps, far from the light,
'The morning star will tremble bright,
Will know the secrets of death's bourn;
By me alone his soul was moved!"...?
Will you not stop to shed a tear
Lethe will drown all memory
23.
Past six, Onegin will be waiting.'
His vein then was dark and languid,
On him, when he heard his name,
On the page, on the word ideal,
(The Romantic style, or so they say,
He slept at last, but fitfully,
In it: no matter, that's by the way).
One with a fashionable feel.
Called by his neighbour, forcefully.
'Up now, and no procrastinating:
Though I fail to see what's romantic
At last near dawn, his weary head
Nodding, he laid it down instead
Yet sleep had barely laid its claim
24.
Is sleeping soundly: in the yard,
In blissful sleep, it's certain,
The sun now dispels the darkness,
Looks out, noting it is day,
A brief snow-flurry spirals by,
The night's shadows thinning swiftly,
The winged god hovers overhead.
Onegin slumbers on regardless.
And high time to be on his way.
And pulls aside the curtain;
The cock-crow hails the morning star;
At last he stirs, sits up in bed
Eugene continues to lie
But he's in error; our Yevgeny
25.
To ready himself, have all in place,
Carry the weapons, as before,
The sledge is waiting, at the door,
Then Onegin swiftly dresses,
Orders Guillot, since time presses,
Hastily he rings; the servant,
And not forget the pistol-case.
He's in, and flying to the mill.
The horses to the oak nearby.
Fresh linen: take time by the ears;
Guillot, his French valet, appears;
Slippers, dressing-gown: this instant;
(Lepage's make, of course) and tie
Arrived, asks Guillot if he will
26.
Zaretsky asked, 'is your second?'
Resolute, impatient, waited,
Just anyhow and let him lie,
Eugene came to apologise,
'But where on earth,' with surprise,
A classicist, and pedant both,
Leaning on the dam-wall, Lensky,
While, quite the engineer, Zaretsky,
(A predilection we should praise).
Surveyed it, and pontificated.
In matters of duelling reckoned
He'd not allow a man to die
But by rule, and he was loath
To deviate from established ways
27.
He is a man of honour too.'
Behind the mill, while there, apart,
Though he is unknown to you,
Not? Besides I'd have you know,
Zaretsky bites his lip, crossly,
The opponents wait, with downcast eyes.
He's here, my friend, Monsieur Guillot.
While Onegin turns to Lensky:
'My second?' - echoes Yevgeny:
With the man of honour, and sighs;
'Shall we begin?' 'Begin, why not?
Zaretsky establishes what's what
Vladimir replies. They start
That can't be a problem, surely
28.
Not long before, tender-hearted,
Could they not speak and smile again,
Before blood left its scarlet stain,
Each had acted like a brother,
Where in cold blood opposing broods,
Part in kindness, giving quarter? ...
Breeds fear of reconciliation.
By this cruel thirst to kill each other.
In silence, plan each other's slaughter.
Sharing pleasures, meals, and thought.
Opponents! They'd not long been parted
But the world's scornful expectation
On nightmare, like those ancient feuds
Now hostility had brought
29.
Bullets are loaded, weapons cocked,
The jagged flints once firmly seated,
Each with a pistol in his hand,
Into the pans they sift the powder,
On ramrods, and they grate together,
- The duellists remove their cloaks,
While Zaretsky measures nicely,
Poor Guillot stands, uneasily,
Here's an end to all their jokes -
Are raised again, the work's completed.
Opposite his friend must stand.
Thirty two paces, precisely.
Pistols gleam, hammers are knocked
Behind the stump of a nearby tree
30.
Strikes for the poet, at the sound,
Lensky, keen to avoid mistake,
Squints, half-closes his left eye,
Not yet attempting to aim,
Yevgeny, silently advances,
They've taken four steps already,
'Now, approach!' Calm and steady,
Takes aim now - when, suddenly,
A few steps from eternity,
His weapon spirals to the ground.
Four fatal steps, to kill or maim.
Five more paces now they take;
Raises his pistol slowly, glances;
Onegin fires...the clock on high
31.
A block of snow will slowly glide,
Has met his fate before his time,
He's lost: the votary of rhyme,
The flower has faded from the bough,
Runs to his friend, gazes at him,
On a steep slope, in the sun's rays,
Pressing his hand to his heart,
Not pain, but death. So, at the start,
The storm is done, and cruelly,
Then gather momentum in its slide.
The altar-fire's extinguished now.
Calls out his name...uselessly:
Struck by an icy chill, Onegin
Lightly, he falls. His gaze betrays
32.
Now like some deserted place,
With shadows all its gloomy space,
Motionless, like one dreaming,
Blood from his wound is streaming,
All is silent, shuttered, still,
Had fired this heart, pure inspiration,
A pulse, the blood's living heat,
Hope and love and enmity,
Where to? God knows. The trail is dead.
The lady of the manse has fled.
The bullet shattering his chest.
Strange his languor, there, at rest;
Windows pale within, that fill
A moment since, imagination
33.
My friends, in bending: 'It is I!'
Across a gentlemanly space,
Yet, should you succeed, beware,
Pleasant to see it hit the mark,
To see, unwillingly, as they pass,
As he lowers horns, stubbornly,
To infuriate your enemy,
More pleasant still, if he should cry,
There's very little pleasure there.
And anticipate his funeral.
His own features in the glass;
Is to aim at his pallid face
It's pleasant with a sharp remark
But the pleasantest thing of all
34.
A fatal wound on some young friend,
Stiffening, as his friends stand round,
To watch him lying on the ground,
With some nonsense while your drinking,
In his face the pains of death,
Hearing his last failing breath,
Deaf, voiceless, never to reply,
To your heartfelt, despairing cry?
With your self-image? He may offend
Issue an angry challenge, thinking
Summon sufficient self-control
He ought to do so - will your soul
What if your pistol-shot inflicts
Whose rash look or sneer conflicts
35.
Then, at Zaretsky's insistence,
Gripped by feelings of remorse,
Placing it carefully in the sleigh,
Steel bits and traces flecked with foam,
The horses scent the dead, and rear,
They lift the cold body to its bier,
Eugene stares down at Lensky,
'Killed!'...And with that stark reply,
Still clutching his pistol, tightly,
'Well?' says Zaretsky, with force.
As they fly like arrows towards home.
Then carry the dread thing away.
Summons the servant for assistance;
Onegin shudders, turns, gives a cry
36.
Prematurely blighted, doomed!
Killed before his promise bloomed,
You, phantoms born of reverie,
The fear of error, and of shame,
That thirst for truth, toil's midnight flame,
That pure emotion youth may render,
Where is the storm of love's extremes,
And you, the bright celestial dreams,
Those high aims ambition fashions,
Where now are the burning passions,
Forced to forgo that sweet tomorrow,
Friends, for the poet now you sorrow,
Thoughts and feelings, noble, tender?
You, gleams of sacred poetry?
37.
Perhaps for glory he was created,
Perhaps that lyre, to silence fated,
To make the soul of man rejoice,
Found his place, or, martyred shade,
A hymn can reach, or people's praise,
Might have achieved its high mission,
Or to ease the world's condition,
The holy secret, lost forever,
Or gratitude from age to age.
Into the dark may have conveyed
The power of some life-giving voice
One that, beyond the grave, never
Echoing down the years. The poet
Might have climbed Parnassus yet
38-39.
Doctors, and weeping women, dead!
Midst swarms of children, lie in bed,
The Muse he might well have deserted,
Settled, to married life converted,
Might have met the usual fate,
Deep in the country, far from town,
Youth slipped by, years to forget,
At forty suffer from the gout,
Eat, drink, yawn; ill, and stout,
Then prove his own mortality,
The soul's fire cooling of late.
And learned life's bland reality:
Worn horns, and a dressing-gown;
Or alternatively the poet
40.
Fell at a friend's hand! You'll discover,
Reader, alas, that tender lover,
Young poet of meditative thought,
Whatever the future might have brought,
Where, above shadowy waters blent,
There stands a simple monument.
Towards the valley down below;
Their thirst, clink pitchers in the flow;
Where the roots are intertwined
Of two tall pines; where waters wind
As you leave the village, a place
That inspired soul knew, a space
His rest; girl reapers, keen to slake
Where the ploughman likes to take
41.
With the springtime showers again)
Lightly at the lines, by chance,
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Of its inscription, feel pity there,
For the summer, bored with town,
The shepherd, weaving his bast shoes,
A haze of tears to cloud her eyes.
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
Lifting the gauzy veil may glance
Racing the meadowlands alone
On reading their sad tale - surprise
Nearby (when the furrows ooze
And the young city lady, down
Grip the reins, and from her hair
42.
And that fugitive from the world,
Brooding silently, she'll ride,
The gloomy eccentric, where is he,
Lost in the depths of reverie,
Then, across the fields, slowly,
The smart coquettes' smart enemy,
To supply the details, by and by.
With Lensky's fate pre-occupied;
Did she pine for him?' She'll wonder;
'And then what became of Olga?
Who to his grave the poet hurled?
And what of her sister, where is she?
'Or did her sorrow vanish swiftly?
All in good time, trust me, I'll try
43.
I'll return to him: no more!
In the world's noise, or solitude,
Age demands prose for a time,
Love my hero, as before,
Another dream, and one more chill,
Scattered reams with flying quill,
Another care, profounder pain,
And promise you, most sincerely,
And I -with a sigh, I confess -
On my troubled mind intrude.
Age drives away the urchin, rhyme.
I now enjoy composing less.
Now, I no longer rush to stain
But not quite yet. Although I dearly
44.
(That I'd once happily rehearse)
Conceit of elegiac verse,
I've learnt to know another longing,
I've learnt the sadness of tomorrow,
And I lament my former sorrow.
In yesterday there is no trusting;
My springtime's over, in the sere?
And you (its rhyme forever) youth?
The dream! Where's sweet elusive truth?
And thirty years the prize I earn?
Can it be true there's no return?
Is now quite withered by the blast?
Can it be true, and not a mere
Can it be true, that crown at last
45.
Oh my frivolous lost youth!
The torments of the soul, the pain,
My thanks for every sweet refrain,
Lived you to the full, in riot,
Pale afternoon is here, my heart,
Then so be it: in friendship part,
The noise, the tempests, and the feast,
For all your gifts, even the least,
I travel another road, at last,
My thanks. I took my joy, and more...
Confess it now, behold: the truth.
Freed from the burdens of the past.
Enough! Again, my soul is pure;
Or in solitude, and quiet;
46.
Long hours of idle reverie!
Immerse in, so relentlessly!
Filled with sweet passion, pensive shade,
Backward, I glance. Farewell the glade,
The poet's soul from every ill,
In society's toils that kill,
Find fresh powers; Imagination,
And you, my youthful inspiration,
Rouse the dull mind from sleep,
Or worse still, freeze and petrify,
Where days flowed by so lazily,
Let it not wither, harsh and dry,
The muddy pool, my friends, that we
Visit my humble corner, keep
Chapter Seven
Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
Where shall we find your like?
Dimitriev
How can we not love our Moscow?
Baratynsky
Where could be better? - Where there are none of us!
Scorn Moscow? Is the world so marvellous?
Griboyedov
1.
The cattle low; a nightingale,
Driven by the springtime sun,
A brilliant azure lights the sky,
Nature wakes from dream, lightly,
In night's deep silence, tells its tale.
The naked woods show downy green.
Down to the flooded fields below.
Greets the new season, brightly.
Goes to raid nature's treasury.
The valleys show a dappled sheen;
Out of its waxen cell, the bee
And still transparent to the eye
Flows in turbid streams that run
From the neighbouring hills, the snow
2.
You fill my soul, and my blood!
In some peaceful rural place!
Spring, ah Spring! The time of love!
Breath of spring caress my face,
And yet how sad you seem to me,
To me - joyous things that shine,
Bringing boredom, anguish, then,
With what strange languid agony,
All that is glad, lives, never mine -
To a soul that perished long ago;
And all this world dark below?
How heavy the emotion weighing
On my heart, to feel the straying
Are all such things quite alien
3.
Of another, older spring,
Of leaves that vanished in the fall,
Our past forever dead, forsaken,
Or finding Nature re-awaken,
Dreams of a country, lost too soon,
Do we recall those doomed to burn,
O magic night, enchanted moon...
Hearing fresh whispers sigh and call?
Years long gone, now faded embers?
And, in the aching heart, set free
Or some poetic reverie
A memory to the mind may bring
Or un-consoled by the return
Perhaps the troubled soul remembers
4.
To the fields, my friends! Run, run!
Whom Epicurean maxims rule,
You rustic Priams, elemental,
Spring calls you to the fertile soil,
Warmth, growth and outdoor toil,
You acolytes of Levshin's school,
Long walks, and fresh inspiration,
Drawn by post-horses, or your own,
You fortunate philosophers,
It's time, you inveterate idlers,
And to those seductive nights,
In coaches, burdensome or light,
And all you ladies sentimental -
Forgo the city's ceaseless drone.
5.
Where he's no longer to be found,
That our Yevgeny found a bore,
Beside that nameless river shore,
Join me and my capricious Muse,
And you, my dear indulgent reader,
Flee the metropolis, its bother,
And listen to the forest news,
And where he spent those icy days,
As a recluse, idle, gloomy,
In foreign gig that you employ,
Though sad echoes still resound.
Know lives in a dreamy haze;
That all last winter gave you joy;
Near young Tatyana, whom we
6.
Rest, poet, from your pilgrimage.'
Who met with an untimely end,
To where the silent shallows gleam,
We'll take the trail towards the stream,
Where the nightingale, spring's lover,
'Here, young Vladimir Lensky lies,
Where two shadowy pine trees grow,
Through meadows, down a lime-tree alley,
Deep in the hill-encircled valley,
Bank and brake, sweet waters flow -
At such and such a date, and age;
The passer-by can read the legend
Sings all night, wild roses cover
On the stone, with his own eyes
7.
Today...no wreath hangs on the bough,
The woodland path is overgrown,
Sits there as he's accustomed to,
Two girls, when the moon shone clear,
Their arms entwined about each other,
And dark beneath the branches' cover,
When morning breezes filled the air,
Over the simple urn below,
Only the shepherd, aged now,
And sings, and plaits a lime-bark shoe.
A wreath once swayed to and fro.
Would haunt the grave, and shed a tear.
The tale forgotten and the stone;
On a pine-branch bending there
8-10.
Pine for you, and mourn your fate!
Lowered eyes their gleams eclipse,
A Lancer, who was loved again,
Flattery soon soothed her pain,
Another star had its ascension,
Another captured her attention,
She stands, blushing with emotion,
At the altar, head bowed down,
Soon, beneath the bridal crown,
Alas! Young girls are faithless ever,
A Lancer, with undying devotion...
The dove will soon forget its mate.
While a soft smile adorns her lips.
Poor Lenksy! Not for long did Olga
11.
Awaits us all, at the end,
Voice of lover, foe and friend,
Are heard, perverse, insatiate,
Sleep soundly, in oblivion,
Poor Lensky! In the grave's far bourn,
Falls silent. Only heir, heiress,
Beyond the voiceless boundary,
The world to him both sealed and dumb? ...
Quarrelling over our estate.
His knowledge of her frailty?
In deep forgetfulness, does he
Did the singer sadly mourn
So be it! Neutral nothingness
Or by Lethe blissfully
12.
The old mother, broken-hearted,
Round the carriage, she was there,
When on the porch they said goodbye,
Her face, like one about to die.
To say her farewells to the pair.
Must go, a slave to army law.
Was heard at the Larin's no more:
It seemed she could barely breathe;
Yet Tanya scarcely seemed to grieve;
Only a strange sad pallor clouded
Kissed, and fussed about, and crowded
Wept for her daughter; as they parted
Back to his regiment, her choice
And soon our Olga's chiming voice
13.
Alone, alone it seemed for good!
By melancholy tears oppressed,
She wanders, purposeless, a shade,
Is carried far from her by fate,
Her confidante, her own sweet dove,
The ally she was born to love,
Seeing nothing there to gladden,
Gazes at the empty garden,
Alas! Her friend of many a day,
Eyes misted, as they sped away...
Forever now, they separate.
Her aching heart can find no rest.
No solace in the silent glade:
And for a long while Tanya stood
14.
Her silent passion's more intense,
Onegin, in this desolation,
Now, in her cruel isolation,
Of all, oblivion; this too,
That she should hate him now forever,
Far off, invades her every sense.
His darling to another wed;
The murderer of their dear friend;
Like smoke dispersing in the blue;
Perhaps, for him...And yet, why grieve?
All memory of him swiftly fled
The poet is no more...the end
Two hearts there are, two that grieve
She knows she must not see him, ever
15.
A glittering stream beside a garden!
On the far bank, the smoky flare,
A fisherman's fire: Tanya there,
A village, a house among the trees,
In the silvery moonlight, dreams,
She gazes - feels a throbbing start,
Walks on forever: on and on.
Quietly flows. The beetle drones.
From the field, with hushed tones.
While faster, stronger pounds her heart.
The rural dancers now retire
Dusk falls. The sky is dark. The river
Then from the heights she sees
Alone, where the meadow gleams
16.
The dogs run towards her, barking,
A noisy crowd; and fighting, larking,
From the yard the serf-boys fly,
But swiftly, at her nervous cry,
'Should I turn back now, or go on? ...
I'm not known; he's not about...
That Tanya can reach the door.
She hesitates, is filled with doubt:
Her to the wide deserted court:
Why not view the house, or garden?
Drive the dogs off, to ensure
The hill slope and where it ends
So scarcely breathing, she descends
Looks about her...fate has brought
17.
The master often brooded there.'
'Could I, perhaps, just see inside?'
'Where's Anisya with the key?'
The old crone comes at their call,
Ushers Tanya through the hall,
Lies on the billiard table's top,
'By the fireplace, there's his chair,
On the divan, a riding-crop.
Our hero's previous address.
The lads run to find a guide:
The housekeeper nods her through:
Echoing in its emptiness:
She gazes: a discarded cue
Tatyana asks: And instantly
18.
That they by Mother Earth are blessed!
The cards, and play whist with me,
Before the young man's death, he'd dine,
He'd sit here of a Sunday,
'And here with our neighbour, Lensky,
The steward came; he'd read a book...
In winter-time. Please, follow me:
His soul's at peace, his bones at rest:
See here too, my old master's nook;
On that very couch, and rest;
Don his spectacles to see
Here's his study, he'd recline
Sip coffee; or at his request
By that window: now I pray
19.
With a Persian fabric spread,
Tatyana with deep emotion,
Each object is, to her notion,
The twilit view beyond the glass,
Cast-iron statue which they pass,
The desk with its shaded light,
Wide gloomy brow and bicorn hat.
Gazes, painfully, around her;
The soul with torment and delight;
The pile of books, then the bed
Lord Byron's portrait, by a small
The clouded moon, and on the wall
A priceless treasure, here to stir
Napoleon, arms crossed, with that
20.
Our Tanya, not without a sigh,
In this fashionable monk's cell,
If she might return to see her,
It's time to leave. Feigning calmness,
And as for our young votaress,
And, if permitted, by and by,
Tatyana lingers: she's spell-bound.
That room to sit in, read, and muse.
The darkened river, vapours fill;
The moon is hidden by a hill;
Departs the room, yet asks Anisya
Blows chill; the sleeping groves, around
Though the house is empty, use
But it grows late; the wind as well
21.
Though, in her indifference,
Lost in her own deep reverie,
At first they make but little sense,
Then, intrigued by the collection,
And at long last claim attention,
Oblivious of the world around her,
She weeps. The books surround her,
She parts then, from the housekeeper,
At the gate, says her goodbyes,
Enters the study silently,
To an unknown world's enthralled.
Wakes, and to the house she flies.
She samples them, and as if called
Yet at dawn the restless sleeper
22.
His spirit egotistical,
Or two, the age drawn with �lan,
Poet of the Giaour and Don Juan,
Onegin's love for books, we know,
Penned with unerring accuracy,
With vain ideas the brain conceives.
And lost in endless reverie;
A creature heartless and amoral;
There were some favourites he kept;
Byron was there - and novels, one
A profile of contemporary man
Among the many doomed to go
An embittered mind that seethes
Had vanished long ago, and yet
23.
Was revealed, recorded whole,
In the margins where, with care,
The imprint of his fingernail,
To follow him, pursued the trail,
To see what fresh enlightenment,
Trembling too, with her intent,
He'd agreed, what found absurd.
Comment; now a question-mark.
Unconsciously, apparent there:
Eugene had found, with what word
Now an underline; now a dark
He'd made pencil marks, his soul
And Tanya all attention, keen
On many pages could be seen
24.
An empty phantom, or a joke,
A Muscovite in Childe Harold's cloak,
A devil in pride, or yet an angel,
Was he from Heaven or from Hell,
His nature, comprehend the man,
A poor second-hand illustration,
Which was he? Mere imitation,
For whom her heart was made to burn,
A fashionable glossary,
That sad and dangerous mystery,
By fate's implacable decree.
A lexicon, a parody?
And so my Tanya began
- Thank God - bit by bit, to learn
25.
'What's to be done? She's not a child.'
She'll brood, or roam the woods alone.'
'Olga's younger, yet she's wed,
At home they're already waiting,
Had she solved the conundrum,
The clock runs swiftly on and on,
The guests have come, the hour is past,
Tanya should be married too.
Her mother's scarcely reconciled:
She's the subject they're debating:
But what on earth is one to do?
Had she found the word at last?
She turns them all down, instead
It's: "I won't." Then on her own
26.
Moscow's a better market-place!
'She's not in love then?' 'Tell me who!
Himself! I thought: "He's the one,"
Come, borrow from me, within reason.'
That Hussar, Pykhtin, she confused,
He was quite infatuated,
'You could afford a winter season,
'But oh, the expense, not like here!' -
The setting for a pretty face.' -
But no! Not a bit of it, he's gone.' -
Buyanov's asked her: she refused.
And Petushkov - spurned him too.
'You must widen the net, my dear.
Flattered her, smiled, ingratiated
27.
Of shy provincial innocence,
Of fashions always out of date,
To face society's derision,
Of beaus and Circes speak her fate! ...
Funds for a Moscow winter found.
Advice both sensible and sound.
Deep in the woods, than do as bidden.
Tanya had news of the decision.
Present the clearest evidence
And let the proud and mocking gaze
Oh, horror! Better safely hidden
Of simple speech and rural ways
Her mother always valued greatly
The accounts were done, and swiftly
28.
Farwell to you, my freedom, too!
What future does fate hold in store?'
And you, familiar woods I love,
'Farewell, you valleys, peaceful, dear,
She rushes to the open fields,
Rising with the morning light,
Her sad eyes tearful and bright,
For a noisy world of vanities...
And to deep emotion yields:
Farwell beauty of skies above;
You too, familiar hills, I fear;
Farewell nature, my joy, adieu;
And why? What am I striving for?
I leave such quiet haunts as these
29.
The Enchantress, Winter: here is she!
And here is autumn golden-browed,
And now the north wind drives the cloud,
Then nature trembles, deathly pale,
There is a stream, and here a hill,
All her daily walks grow longer,
Yet all too soon the summer ends,
The groves and meadows at her feet,
Blows and howls - and presently,
A victim, decked out for the gale...
Arresting her against her will.
And speaks to them, as to old friends.
That with sheer beauty charms Tatyana
Seeking their charms she goes to meet
30.
But Tanya's spirit is unmoved,
Levels the borders of the stream,
With her carpet, billowing where it lies,
Scattering herself abroad, she flies,
The frost glitters. We give thanks,
By winter her mute heart's oppressed.
Welcome with joy the winter's pranks.
From the roof, face, shoulders, breast.
Covered with sheets of downy gleam;
The meadows and the slopes of hills;
Indifferent to wintry delights;
Breathing the frosted air of nights;
Washing, with fresh snow, removed
Whitening the oak boughs, and fills
31.
Is here at last, the journey planned,
Re-upholstered, there they stand,
Featherbeds, cockerels in cages,
Chairs, chests, and watering-cans,
Jars of jam, and frying-pans,
The sledded coaches, stored away,
Three large kibitkas, by tradition.
And eighteen nags now appear.
Of things none dare leave behind;
Their loads are placed in position;
Loud farewells, with many a tear;
Pots and basins, jugs; the kind
Then the servant's noise presages
The long-delayed departure day
32.
Farewell, lonely sanctuaries.'
'Farewell now, you haunts of peace,
The servants gather by the gate,
While the breakfast is preparing,
They're harnessed to the master's sleighs,
The load on each kibitka sways,
His nag: it's ill, it nearly died.
In procession, sleigh by sleigh.
Tatyana, with tear-stained eyes.
The ladies seated; then away:
To call a last farewell: it's late;
Wenches and coachmen swearing;
The bearded outrider's astride
'Is this forever', sadly cries
33.
And godly folk will institute,
To drive bold tunnels underwater,
Cast-iron spans will leap the river,
Now estimates we need, in fact,
And stride in arches every way,
Russia will be one great highway,
Fine inns too, all along the route.
Unifying every by-way.
Will be improved to take such loads:
A mere five hundred years) our roads
Have had sufficient time to act
(And philosophic sentiment
When progress and enlightenment
We'll move the mountains, and pay
34.
The fleas at halts drive you mad,
Our neglected bridges crumble,
Slowly, by his slumbering fire,
Before you, simply to excite,
To mend Europe's dainty coils,
Meanwhile the village Cyclops toils,
Inns, there are none. In some hut,
Force you to lie awake, and mumble.
Made by sorcerers and witches.
But as it is, our roads are bad;
In vain, your growing appetite;
With Russian hammer, he'll aspire
Blessing Russia's ruts and ditches
Freezing cold, a menu's put
35.
Like modern verse, our empty rhyme,
The mile-markers soothe the eye,
Our troikas fit to run for years,
So lively are our charioteers,
The tedious halts that, with delays,
The journey took them seven days.
The roads are smooth, the burden light.
Like fence-posts swiftly flashing by.
But then Larina crawled along;
Travel's easy, a delight;
Yet in frozen winter time
To avoid the usual expense
Of post-horses, it made sense
To use their nags, and so prolong
36.
Moscow, I dreamed of you again!
And sound in every Russian heart!
Of park and palace, spire and dome,
In my nomadic exile, then,
How often, dumb with separation,
Ah, friends! How often joyous, too,
Live in that name, what echoes start,
I suddenly beheld that view,
With all its mysteries of home.
Their golden crosses, lifted higher.
White Moscow, stone and blazing fire
Moscow....what depths of fascination
Where cupolas raise to glowing skies
Yet now they're near. Before them lies
37.
Fate had granted, Napoleon,
Waited on Moscow's submission,
But there was no capitulation,
Crawling to him on her knees,
Proud, in its glorious memories,
There the Petrovsky palace rises,
No gift, no feast she gave him now,
Only a mighty conflagration.
The threatening flames skyward soar.
To offer up the Kremlin keys.
My Moscow chose not to bow;
Surrounded by its ancient trees
For here, elated by the prizes
From here, plunged in thought, he saw
38.
Farewell! No lingering here,
Then down Tverskaya Street they bump,
Stalls flash by, and urchins jump,
Sleighs and shacks and boulevards,
Fashionable shops, and yards,
Kitchen-gardens, balconies,
Lamp-posts, mansions, monasteries,
Lions on gates, with frozen roars,
Cossacks, Bokharans, merchants,
Pharmacies, towers, and peasants,
Proud witness of that fallen glory,
Drive on! And, to resume our story,
And church-crosses black with daws.
The city gates gleam white; they're near;
39-40.
A gateway in a lane: at last!
The two old women weep, embrace,
A Kalmuck, in a ragged smock,
His face, the princess, in the parlour,
Two hours at least, but then, once past,
Then rattle on at lightening pace.
Consumptive, four years past, and failing.
Calls her welcome from the sofa;
Her plight indeed is most forlorn;
St Chariton's, the carriage brakes;
They've come to an old aunt who's ailing
Flings wide the door, he holds a sock
He darns, old spectacles adorn
This whole exhausting journey takes
41.
'Who'd have though it?' - 'What an age!
He visited at Christmas...Oh!
'My Grandison? ...Oh, Grandison! Yes!
'Princess, mon ange' - 'Pachette!' - 'Alina!'
His son was wed not long ago,'
Darling, how long can you stay here?'
Do you recall your Grandison?'
In Moscow, he's near St Simeon,
Where is he, now?' 'You'll never guess,
From a novel, yet here you are...!' -
'And this is my own Tatyana.' -
'Ah, Tanya, dear! Come, let me see -
Cousin, it's like a dream to me...
- 'Dear Cousin!' - 'Sit: it's like a page
42.
Old age is pain and wretchedness...'
And as for trouble...well, I'm done for,
It's all too much such happiness,
Oh, I've no strength...it's my chest...
We both should take a little rest...
She wept, endured a coughing bout.
No use it seems, any more:
Must be worn out with travelling;
With that her weary voice gave out;
For all of that now, have we not?
Betray me, while you poor thing
We'll show off Tanya, a pity though
I can't go out: my legs they're what
'And he...but we've time tomorrow
43.
Her eyes: the bell towers chime,
And wake her many and many a time,
As the shadows slowly wane,
But only a yard, strange, immense,
She finds all unfamiliar, still,
Behind the strange bed's silken drapes,
No fields prove to be her neighbours,
Stables, kitchens, and a fence.
Her former room she can't forget.
Calling Moscow to its labours;
Seated by the window pane
The invalid's kind words must fill
She lies for hours, while sleep escapes
Tanya with gratitude, and yet
44.
And boxed you ears, a time or two!
Last year was it? I dandled you!
'Goodness how the years speed by!'
Despite the pallor languor gives,
Welcome her with open arms,
With exclamations at her charms,
Greet her enthusiastically,
With copious hospitality.
To the old dears' perennial cry:
Every day, both near and far;
Grandmamma and grandpapa
And fed you cake!' Tanya's barely listening
'How Tanya's grown! Your christening
They dine out at the relatives
45.
Her same friend Monsieur Finemouche,
The same husband, the same pooch,
Her spouse the club's most loyal member,
There's Princess Helena's tulle bonnet,
But none of them have changed a bit,
As meek, as deaf, who, nothing new,
Still eats and drinks enough for two.
They keep to their habitual ways:
A liar yet, Lubov Petrovna;
Powder-white Lukerya Lvovna;
Semyon Petrovitch, still the miser;
Ivan Petrovich, none the wiser;
The one she wore in former days;
With Aunt Pelageya Nikolevna
46.
They find her strange, somewhat affected,
Unfashionable, but that's expected,
Invite her home, too, in the end,
Squeeze her hand, kiss their friend,
And in a sing-song voice confide,
In all, not unacceptable,
Fluff her hair to suit, dear creature,
And soon reveal their better nature,
Their daughters offer their embraces,
They, dear Moscow's living graces,
Then gaze at Tanya, silently,
Some girlish secret that they hide.
Survey provincial mystery;
A little pale and thin, but all
47.
The joy and pain she's cherishing,
Dreaming, understanding nothing,
Of her own heartfelt confession,
Tell of their conquests, others' too,
The deepest secret of her heart,
Hoarding her treasure silently,
Embellished by their jealousies.
Concealing its reality.
Their hopes, their pranks, their reveries;
In exchange, her hopes and fears;
And then demand an expression
But Tatyana, scarcely hears
Guarding with unconscious art
The guileless stories, not a few
48.
She feels are things she should share,
Stale gossip, news, of that they're full,
The chatter, and the conversation,
Not even plain idiocy redeems,
Even their slanders meaningless,
All is so pale and colourless,
Not even a joke half-innocent,
Not even just by accident,
But never a fresh thought all day,
Lights the mind with its bright ray,
With vulgar tales is coarse and bare.
Their empty world, or so it seems.
Their questions pointless, dry and dull;
But drawing-room pre-occupation
49.
Quite rarefied, review my Tanya,
Asked her name, straightened his wig,
In the doorway, idly preening,
Prince Vyazemsky sat beside her,
Comparing notes, like circling sharks,
Fashionable Record Office clerks,
And gave his neighbour's ribs a dig.
And pass sarcastic judgement on her.
Rhymes her, in an elegy.
Was for a while her entertainer;
Once calling on an aunt, the bored
And an old man whom she'd ignored
One melancholy jester leaning
Finds her Ideal, and fitfully
50.
Our days of youth, now past and done)
And there, where bold Melpomene,
Where only fair Terpsichore,
Our Tanya, no discerning eye,
Where Thalia is quietly napping,
No connoisseur with opera glass,
Wailing aloud her tragic part,
(As was the case in times gone by,
Waves her mantle, somewhat tawdry,
Awakes a young man's loyalty,
From loge or parterre, saw her pass.
Heedless of their friendly clapping;
Grants an indifferent crowd her art;
No lorgnettes were trained upon
51.
To show themselves, twirl, and jingle,
Proud beauties' in their flimsy dresses,
The balcony, whose throng oppresses,
Of candlelight, the dancers fleet,
Display their vests, or form a set,
Marriageable girls there, in a crescent,
Shine, conquer, and retreat, still single.
And dangle the careless lorgnette.
The crush, the stir there, and the heat.
Muddling the wits of all those present.
She graces the Assembly Rooms:
The blare of music, and the fumes
While Hussars, on leave, have but
Here acknowledged dandies strut
52.
What languor fills her breast, my sweet!
Beyond my importunate lyre,
Among the wives and daughters seen,
The Moscow belles are many too,
The glittering night holds many a star,
Yet the one whom I set higher,
With what heavenly grace, advances,
Touching the earth with her light feet,
What languor's in her magic glances!...
The tribute that to folly's made.
Than they, in that celestial blue.
But enough, enough: you've paid
Like the majestic moon serene
Yet brighter shines the moon by far
53.
Or the lime-tree alley's shade,
Detesting all the social whirl,
Gazes unseeing at the swirl,
And its attendant rivulets gleam,
To her village, despite its hovels,
Her garden, her romantic novels,
By a pillar, between two aunts,
Noise, laughter, curtsey, bow,
Unnoticed, Tanya seated now,
Mazurka, gallop, waltz...they dance.
Where he his visitation made.
The lonely grove where a stream
It stifles her...her spirit yearns
For rural life, and memory turns
54.
'What that fat general?' - 'He's gone!'
He's walking off...he's sideways on...'
The world; the ball, are left behind,
The aunts, unsure what to think,
Nudge each other, slyly wink,
Yet one keen gaze has settled on her,
His eyes from you...there now, quickly,
'Look to the left, now, there's a thing.' -
'To the left? Where? What's to see?' -
'Never you mind that, just look...
A General's, noble, to my mind.
Then poke Tatyana, whispering:
So far away her visions wander;
Two, in uniform; he hardly took
55.
Enough. My shoulder's from the plough!
Though late, have the exordium too!
And of his every caprice,
May this, my epic, if you please,
It is of my young friend, I sing,
I've bowed to classicism: you,
With your staff point out the way,
Should be forgot...so, opportunely,
Lest from the chosen path I stray.
I'll set a few words echoing:
O Muse, receive your blessing now;
Turn to my hero, lest his fate
And now I must congratulate
Tanya on her luck, but swiftly
Chapter Eight
Fare thee well!  and if for ever,
Still forever, fare thee well.
Byron
1.
Apuleius won my praise,
In the first bright flower of youth,
Sang youthful joy, and childhood dear,
Over waters still and clear,
And in spring, in hidden vales,
Where the swan in beauty sails,
In those old Lyceum days,
The Muse set my world alight,
Sang Russia's glorious ages past,
There the Muse first came near.
And all the dreams the heart holds fast.
While Cicero I loathed, in truth;
Then my student cell was bright
2.
On the far heights, where he strayed,
The world received her with a smile,
Derzhavin, at the grave's dark sill,
Who mingled with some pure lament,
Yet built an eternal monument,
Felitsa's virtues set to rhyme -
Though we decried them, at the time.
Thoughts of fleas and lemonade;
The noble ode's great master still;
Blessed our first poor offerings;
Those first successes gave us wings;
To speak the language of the heart;
Derzhavin, lingering here a while
Derzhavin he who tuned his art
3.
My flighty mistress and my pride,
Tasting the crowd's idle pleasure,
For wilful passion was my measure,
Wooed by all that ardent throng,
The noisy brawl, the banquet's roar,
And to the revels and the feast,
The Muse was ever at my side.
In that sweet golden youth of mine:
The only law that I employed;
To sing for the guests above the wine;
Taunting the watch at midnight's door;
She brought her glories, never ceased
My lively Muse and I enjoyed
Like a Bacchante, danced along
4.
Galloping onwards at my side!
Like pale Lenore, in moonlit ride,
And in Caucasian gorges, join me,
How often to the Tauric shore,
The praise the endless tides rehearse,
The thundering breakers' mighty roar,
She'd divert me, or her laughter,
She'd lead me in the dead of night,
To hear the Nereids' whispers bright,
And when I fled that company,
For the Father of the Universe.
Far off...the Muse followed after.
On my long and silent journey;
How often, with some secret story
5.
She'd visit every spot with me,
And there grew wild as they: all sense,
Sad-eyed there, sits on a bench,
Then all was altered, and again,
Its feasts forgotten and its speeches,
Abandoned for barbaric tongues,
And far away from our great city,
Strange broken music of the steppes...
Clasps in her hand a book, in French.
Of Moldavia's gloomy reaches;
Now a provincial girl, she steps;
Nomadic tribes in humble tents;
Through my garden, once urbane
The language of the gods, her songs
6.
Then proud ladies, see her glide,
And, seated quietly by my side,
Admire the dense and noisy hum,
The ladies framed by gentlemen,
The gleam of wit and silken dress,
Military dandies, diplomats,
Past the ranked aristocrats,
All, sombrely, surrounding them.
Sight of her sweet rural display.
To the young hostess, one by one;
My Muse with a grand soire;
Now, for the first time, I reward
And jealously the world afford
The presentation of the guests
7.
Truly? ...Yes, indeed, our hero!
- 'It's long since he was here though!'
And seems an utter alien here,
The conversation of the powerful,
As tedious phantoms? Is that spleen,
She likes the orderly progression,
Or tortured vanity, dark, quiescent,
But who, in this select assembly,
Is he, who lingers silently,
Of rank and age with which the hour's full.
Who is the man? Is this Eugene?
In his face? Why is he present?
Pride's cold politeness, the procession
To whom the passing forms appear
8.
He's fooled us far too long, and so...'
- 'You know him then?' - 'Well, yes and no.'
Is it the same plan he once followed,
Or a decent fellow - you or me,
He pursues, or something more,
Or less: what role? Perhaps Melmoth,
Some new work of the mask-maker,
Childe Harold, bigot, or Quaker,
Cosmopolitan, patriot,
Is: change your ways, if you're wise.
'Is he the same, or has he mellowed?
Is he as strange now as before?
Society, in short? What I'd advise
9.
Suits the likes of you and me?'
Is found disturbing, on the whole,
Or we confuse deeds with chatter,
- 'But why berate him so severely,
Is it because we're given, clearly,
To judging other ways of living;
Or we mistake the things that matter;
Or that the stupid are malicious;
Rewarding the merely meretricious;
Or intellect prompts mockery;
By self-satisfied nonentity;
Why are you so unforgiving?
Or that a fiery headstrong soul
That only mediocrity
10.
In his twenties, a dandy bred,
His thirties, profitably wed,
At fifty tolerably debt-free,
Obtaining wealth, and rank, and fame,
Blessed is he, who in youth was young,
Who, as the years went by unsung,
Never scorned the world's advances,
Who never harboured foolish fancies,
X was a fine man, anyway.
Of whom the age is bound to say:
Discarding friends to win the same;
Learnt to endure their colder clime;
Who only ripened in good time;
Achieving peace at last, and plenty;
11.
Find life a ritual, dull and dead,
The formal dinners stretch ahead,
Hourly we betrayed its truth,
Was granted to us all in vain,
Driven by its laws and fashions,
Follow the bland crowd that bores us,
Our brightest hopes, and the best,
Our dreams, those dearer than the rest,
Like autumn leaves, that fall and stray,
Indifferent to its thoughts and passions.
Blown by the wind, in swift decay.
Hourly it cheated us, again:
Alas it's sad to think that youth
Unbearable to see before us
12.
It's wretched (I trust you'll agree),
Bored with leisure in the end,
His story) having killed his friend,
Found, without rank, career, or wife,
Once scorned by the malicious,
As affected, strange and vicious,
Without an aim on which to fix,
Reaching the age of twenty-six,
To be condemned impartially,
A melancholy oddity,
A satanic monstrosity,
Nothing to occupy his life.
Or else that Demon of my verse.
Onegin (once more I rehearse
13.
Though some of us are born to range.)
He left his village and his land,
The fields, the woods, that silent stand,
From Griboedov took Chatzky's cue,
Began an aimless wandering,
Till travel, with its tedious motion,
Became a bore, it seemed, unending.
Sped back towards the ball, anew.
(A feeling tortuous and tenacious:
Of Lensky haunted every glade;
Stirred by a solitary emotion;
Where the mute and blood-stained shade
Restlessness, an urge for change
He was pursued by a vexatious
14.
I can't translate that, as I live!)
No pride, and no chilly glance,
No pretension in her advance,
Not cold at all, yet not effusive,
Calm, her gestures unobtrusive,
Stir, as the murmuring swells; for lo,
She seems the image, to excess,
No breath at all of haughtiness,
A lady approaches the hostess,
No affected coquetry....
With a large general in tow.
Only serene simplicity.
Of comme il faut... (Shiskov, forgive:
Where now, exchanging looks, the guests
15.
Of pure respect, followed behind,
In all her person, form or face,
She was no beauty, that is true,
The men all bowed deeply to her,
Of what the fashionable view,
In London sets especially,
Considers vulgar. (Pardon me...
Chest puffed out, content in mind.
Each one tried to catch her eye;
The women all gathered to her;
Young girls, hurrying, fell quiet;
Dowagers smiled as she passed by;
Yet she'd not a single trace
The general, flattered by the diet
16.
The Cleopatra of the Neva,
Yet you'll agree I hope, that diva,
Beside fair Nina Voronskaya,
At the table takes her place,
Nonchalantly, full of grace,
But back now to our theme: Madame,
As dazzling as a flashing sabre,
Despite her beauty bright as fire,
Its use to date is not excessive,
I love the word, it's so expressive,
Though it's perfect for an epigram...).
Cannot quite eclipse her neighbour.
And yet it's one I can't translate;
The honour paid it is not great;
17.
Is speaking? See, she's wearing red.'
The Prince, amused, turns his head,
The Spanish ambassador, there,
In agitation, his lorgnette,
'Do tell me, Prince, now, to whom,
To gaze at will, in her direction,
How? From that wilderness...' He uses,
I'll introduce you. Upon my life!' -
'Yes, but who is she? - 'That's my wife.' -
'Surely it's not' - Yevgeny muses -
Not she? It is though...no...and yet...
Is merely vague, and lost in gloom.
'Where have you been, Onegin, where?
At one of whom his recollection
18.
'You're married then! I'd no idea!
I was their neighbour.' 'Come, my friend...'
'And she's?' - 'A Larin, and a dear.'
Her manner is as self-contained,
The Princess gazes at Eugene,
However much it takes its toll,
And whatever stirs her soul,
With no apparent consternation,
'Tanya!' - 'You know her?' - 'Long ago,
How long?' - 'Oh, two years or so.' -
Her nod as quiet and restrained.
A past acquaintance, and relation.
The Prince presents him, in the end:
Not a tremor can be seen:
19.
There was no trace to be seen,
Where had he come from, and when,
Conveyed a hint, a mere suggestion,
He'd make conversation with her,
Truly! She didn't even shiver,
Turn pale, or blush with distress,
Of boredom to her spouse, was gone...
While Eugene, frozen, lingered on.
Nor did her troubled lips compress.
But - could not. She asked a question:
To gaze on, of the former Tanya;
In that face Eugene was keen
From his estate, perhaps: and then
Her eyelids showed not a quiver
20.
Can this really be Tatyana,
To whom in rural solitude,
The very girl, he'd kept her note,
Of noble phrases, moral too,
In this same romance, earlier,
He'd scorned, for her lack of art,
Though over-zealous, it is true;
Out all the content of her heart;
That young girl...is it a dream...?
Revealed that calm, indifferent brow?
He'd addressed a multitude
Who freely, ardently, once wrote
That young girl, it would seem
Was she the one who but now
21.
For that evening. 'She'll be there...!
I'll go, I'll go' - At once, with care,
Vexation? Vanity? Or, in truth,
He wakes to a solicitation,
His dreams disturb him sadly, sweetly,
Restless till the morning light.
He pens a swift, polite reply.
What stirs there, hidden from the eye?
Can it be love, the care of youth?
Alight in his cold, torpid soul?
What ails him? Is it some strange coal
The Prince has sent an invitation
Drives home again, where that night
He leaves the ball, and pensively
22.
Flies to the house, through the hall,
He hardly speaks. In his dejection,
Enters the salon, with a shiver,
As conversation slowly dies,
And awkwardness, barely replies,
There they sit, the minutes pass,
Onegin's tongue-tied to the last,
Can scarcely wait for night to fall.
Meets her calm untroubled air.
While he is lost in reflection:
Onegin counts the hours, once more;
And finds Tatyana, no one with her;
The clock strikes ten. He's at the door;
Haunted by one thought, his stare
23.
A sprinkling of commonsense,
Neither pedantic nor intense,
This unrewarding t�te � t�te,
And guaranteed not to alarm,
But merely pleasant conversation,
Of wit, froth, free of affectation,
Arrive to laughter, schoolboy jests,
With too much life or wit, but charm.
Talk seasoned with the salt of malice;
To the hostess they raise the chalice
Change of tone, starts to relate
Tales from their past. The guests
And with a smile, and an abrupt
Enter the Prince, to interrupt
24.
Subtle, acute, and, in a word,
Women of a certain age,
In bonnets, roses, all the rage,
The wit of former days displaying,
Here was fashion's finest bloom,
The faces seen in every room,
The gist of some great state affair,
There an old head of scented hair,
And a host of younger girls,
St Petersburg's high society,
All that we now find absurd.
Uncomfortable, unsmiling pearls;
The dullards we deem necessary;
Here an ambassador conveying
25.
At ill-bred men he deprecated,
At every single thing he hated,
Recalling all the good he did,
There a minister, out of office,
His memoirs to an empty coppice,
At lies with which the press was rife,
At tea too sweet, banal Madame,
Tend his roses, and rehearse,
Retired, to write undying verse,
At those sisters' royal decoration,
At some vile novel's reputation,
Though silent on the bad he hid.
At the campaign, the snow, his wife.
Here, one who'd aim an epigram
26.
Caricaturing him, Sen-Pri!
A cherub, motionless, red-faced,
That your pencils were all blunted,
An illustrator's dream, and more,
Over-starched and rather brazen,
And there a seasoned traveller,
For a swift interchange of looks,
And question-marks in several books.
Quite dumb, because so tightly-laced;
Here too was Prolasov, so stunted
In his soul, so worthless he
Who's affectation caused occasion
A ballroom tyrant by the door
27.
Seduced like our ancestor Eve,
By the serpent who'll deceive,
Had betrayed itself in youth,
Was with Tatyana, not, in truth,
Forbidden fruit before our eyes,
Drawn to the tree, and what sours,
But the cold, aloof Princess,
The unapproachable goddess,
Of our proud imperial Neva.
Else paradise is no paradise.
For what we see, not what is ours?
Yet my Eugene's preoccupation
The shy, sweet girl whose adoration
O Human Race! Why such a fever
28.
How perfectly she plays her role!
Rank demands, achieves its goal!
Yet he'd once set her heart awhirl!
How changed now our Tatyana is!
The power to rule, in every feature,
Who in this calm, majestic creature,
Gazing on the moon, its light,
She'd dream of him at dead of night,
Virginal hope within her breast,
Then, till Morpheus brought her rest,
Longing to journey, day by day,
Humbly, with him, on life's way.
Would recognise the tender girl?
How well she carries out the duties
29.
Turning meadowland to marsh,
Yet virgin hearts, despite its pain,
Autumn's gales reveal time's treason,
But in the late and barren season,
At the turning of the years,
Its violent storms, are blessed by it,
A vital force flows from the root,
Passion's tempests will renew,
Bring fresh beauty to the view -
Stripping forests, fierce and harsh.
Bringing flowers, and ripening fruit.
As the fields by springtime rain:
Passion's death-march brings tears:
To love the ages must submit;
30.
Part liveried ranks, to bring relief,
Each day he stands beside her coach,
His mind ignores all self-reproach,
Follows her from door to door,
Or with a burning hand touch hers,
On her shoulders, adjust the furs,
Or, as if they'd ceased to exist,
Make way, retrieve a handkerchief.
Days and nights an anguished joy.
His pleasure merely to assist:
A faithful shadow, nothing more;
Subject now to passion's laws;
Tanya, like a lovesick boy;
Without doubt, Eugene adores
31.
He's pining, with heart laid bare,
She seems to neither see nor care,
Onegin begins to languish,
Or bow to him, make distant mention,
Whatever he may say or do,
With guests, may speak a word or two,
Doctors, they cry: the best by far,
At home receives him equably,
She disregards him utterly,
Betrays no trace of coquetry,
They say in turn's the nearest spa.
Appears consumptive in his anguish.
So frowned on in society.
Or simply pay him no attention;
32.
He pens, though she seems uncaring,
His illness makes him more daring,
Was driven, in no uncertain fashion,
Hopes she'll warm, if he insists,
But he is stubborn and persists,
Yet, inclined to treat them lightly,
To ease the pain his love incurred.
Here is his letter, word for word.
A missive that declares his passion.
(Such is the sex, all Eve's daughters);
To make an end, than take the waters;
He valued such things little, rightly;
Yet he stays; readier, it appears
Though she's unmoved by it, no tears
ONEGIN'S LETTER TO TATYANA
How proud the glance you'll employ!
Open myself to endless blame,
What bitter scorn in your expression,
You deeply, by my sad confession:
Prompting your malicious laughter?
What can I hope for? With what aim
Reveal my soul, and thereafter
I foresee all: how I'll annoy
God! How I erred, and am undone!
When we met, long ago, by chance,
I dared not trust the circumstance,
An exile, and bound to none,
My liberty, though tedious, too,
Though seeing the tenderness in you,
Lensky's luckless sacrifice...
And then, to part us utterly...
Demanded my full attention.
Were substitutes for happiness.
From the heart's true paradise;
Refused to give rein to affection;
I thought that freedom and rest
I tore my heart away, completely
Grow paler, and then die....what bliss!
Your perfection in all this;
Faithfully follow in your footsteps;
Your slightest glance; your smiling lips;
No, to be with you constantly;
And gazing in adoration see
To suffer at your feet and so
To listen to you, and to know
These hours that fate has plotted,
My days are numbered, yet it's true,
If I were certain at first light,
For you, still drag myself about,
By afternoon, of seeing you,
Though precious time goes swiftly,
With all their weary weight allotted.
I could endure until the night.
And, in vain tedium, I play out
That, I'm denied; and, simply
The eye to hides its joyfulness...!
As some deceit the eye lays bare,
To don a mask, in form and speech,
I fear lest this humble prayer,
Pour out complaints, confessions, pleas,
To long to fall there, clasp your knees,
In pain and sorrow, at your feet,
To suffer passion's parching thirst,
In whatever way words can entreat -
Curbs the flames with which I'm cursed.
And your reproach repay in kind.
But if you knew this agony:
May be construed by your mind
Make conversation, and to teach
And yet with a pretended coldness
To burn - while reason forcefully
The fight is done, the sword is still,
I surrender, and my fate.
Yet so be it: here I wait:
All is over: to your will
33.
The echo of midwinter's cold!
Truly his star is in eclipse!
No mark of tears? ...No trace, no sign!
He sends a second and a third,
At some soire where...not a word,
Flares in her face, those eyes ablaze,
And indignation's icy passion,
Still no reply, then he finds her,
For Eugene, falls from her lips,
Only what anger may define.
While he devours her with his gaze.
There's no response. He writes another;
And no confusion, no compassion?
Alas! Her look seems to hold
34.
Through the fashionable scene,
That; and perhaps a hidden fear,
And in his silent room recalls,
More deeply in his lunacy,
Once more rejects society,
All that Onegin knew about her...
In the graveyard's darkest corner.
That folly, that past tenderness.
On his own madness, to immerse
All hope is lost! He leaves: a curse
A time when, pursued by spleen
It had trapped him, like a mourner
Lest the world, her spouse, should guess
35.
Read Fontenelle. He was eclectic,
Of criticism, most profound,
Ready to praise us or to hound,
Read, thus, sundry Russians still,
Almanacs; and journals, too,
Manzoni, Herder, and Chamfort,
Browsed through Gibbon and Rousseau,
Where I'm told I'm nothing new,
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Though once they sang my gifted pen:
Read Bayle, as well, the arch-sceptic;
He read, at random, as before;
All was as grist to his mill;
De Sta�l, Bichat, and Tissot;
36.
Wish, dream, regret for what was gone,
His thoughts were lingering elsewhere,
What then? Though his eyes moved on,
He read, by an inner light,
Between the lines that met his sight,
His mind a whirl, he wandered there.
Or a young girl's letter, pure, intense.
Immersed his soul there, utterly:
Of rumours, threats: prophetic, old;
Of deep passions, ancient, dark;
Inconsequential dreams; the arc
In mysterious legends that told
Those with other meaning. He
Some long fairytale's wild nonsense
37.
She - always she, behind the glass...!
Hears, and then his heart is chilled,
While reading, on both mind and feeling,
And now, recalls past enemies,
Malicious cowards, slanderous players,
And a house - where shadows pass,
He sees a youth there, far below,
Asleep it seems on melting snow,
Words echoing there: Well and Killed.
Its brightly-coloured faro pack.
Slumber steals, the years roll back;
Old companions' cruelties;
A swarm of beauties, cool betrayers;
Now imagination's dealing
38.
Not exactly what we need!
He almost lost his mind, indeed,
Plunged endlessly in reverie,
In a corner, by the fire,
Gazing at the glowing pyre,
And looked a poet, to the letter,
But through some process of osmosis,
Magnetism or hypnosis,
Almost embraced pure poetry -
Or slipper fuelled the flames anew.
The way to turn a verse or two;
Softly humming: Benedetta
Or Idol mio, till his review
My foolish pupil now knew
39.
A poet? No, he wasn't one,
The double windows, cosy fire,
Along the Neva in his sleigh,
To leave his place of hibernation,
Along the streets where snow-melt lies,
And one bright morning, off he flies,
Where on blue ice-floes light-beams play,
Nor went mad, or died, as feared.
The winter snows soon disappeared.
Snug as a marmot might desire;
Where are the horses taking him?
Grey trampled slush; yet, what's his whim?
The spring revived him. He hastened
The days flashed by - and with the sun
40.
The next room too; unoccupied,
To his Tatyana, though rejected,
Reader, you've guessed, as I suspected,
Makes his way, with corpselike face,
Into the lobby's empty space,
Another door, he flings it wide,
Her cheek rests on her hand, she cries,
The princess, in a simple dress,
Reading a letter, silently,
My incorrigible, never weary,
Her tears falling constantly.
And know the answer to my query:
Pale, alone, and in distress;
And halts: what's this, before his eyes?
41.
That instant, and not recognise,
Show neither anger nor surprise,
His frail appearance, wasted look,
Return; that innocent, her dream,
Who could have seen her silent pain,
But gaze at him, as she surveys...
Alive again on memory's stream.
In the princess, Tanya plain:
Eugene lies, his fall complete;
Poor Tanya, in her new disguise?
His dumb remorse; an open book
She shudders, silent, yet her eyes
She sees him clear; and other days
In wild repentance at her feet
42.
Today, it is my turn to speak.'
Motionless and nerveless hand,
And quiet her voice: 'Have done,
She does not try to raise the man,
There in the garden, where we met,
Where, held in the hands of destiny,
That moment - how should we forget? -
Rise, now, this merits explanation.
Her quiet gaze does not falter.
What passes now through her mind?
You preached: the strong to the weak?
The lengthy silence ends, refined
Or from greedy lips, remove her
Eugene, do you see in memory
43.
I thank you now, with all my soul...'
And played an honourable role,
You acted rightly, in my cause,
Is it not so? That girl's affection,
'Eugene, I was so much younger,
And I loved you; ah, what answer,
That heartless icy look of yours,
And prettier then, too, no doubt,
You bear no blame. I can't forget,
Lecturing me, so fiercely...yet,
I freeze - my God! - to think of you,
What reply? A harsh rejection.
Was no surprise: so simple, true?
Issued from your heart's redoubt?
44.
In the eyes of our society?'
Would condemn me in that place,
I offered little interest...ah,
My husband's wound, his valour,
And the shame dishonour brought,
From the whispering tongues, allow,
Would give you notoriety,
Of our world grant me honour;
Why now pay me these attentions?
Make him a favourite at Court?
Why must you pursue me now?
And therefore my fall from grace
'Then, in that rural wasteland, far
Because, rich, noble, the conventions
45.
Ignorance of the pain I feel!
Be so enslaved, so cruel, so blind?'
Can you, with such a heart and mind,
Were it within my power,
Than the insults of this hour,
Your poor Tanya, even now,
You showed respect then...now you kneel.
Your passion, letters and your tears.
Then know: I'd rather suffer all;
That bitter anger, that cold brow;
Why now? What brings you to my feet?
What foolishness, and what complete
'I'm weeping....if you still recall
For my dreams, my tender years
46.
To rest, beneath the woodland shade.'
So far away in time and space,
In an instant, with this pretence,
For a few books, a garden glade,
The noise, the glare, the masquerade,
For the simple churchyard there,
Our old modest dwelling, where,
What are they? I could dispense,
This house, the soires, my whole fate,
This tinsel of a life I hate,
The homage rank may engender,
Eugene, I first saw your face;
The place where my poor nurse was laid
'To me Onegin all this splendour
47.
And will be faithful to my vow.'
I love you (why should I pretend?)
'Then happiness seemed possible,
I married. And now, you must leave her,
And yet, I am another's now,
Perhaps I turned away too swiftly,
Seemed as one to poor Tatyana...
Is carved in stone, immutable.
Your pride; these feelings shown.
I know, her honour with your own;
I beg you, go: and you'll defend
That I should wed...all paths from there
But...my mother's tears, her prayer
So near! ...But now my destiny
48.
And with what storms his body shook!
Congratulate ourselves. Hurray!
About time too! (I hear you say?)
Have wandered far enough, for me,
His heart the tempest now stripped bare,
She left, yet still Eugene stood there,
So, Reader, in that sorry state,
For long? ...Forever. For we,
Tatyana's husband looms near,
Through this wide world. We bow,
As if a lightning bolt had struck.
I must abandon him for now.
I leave my hero, to his fate:
But now a clink of spurs, and here
49.
And so we part, again farewell!
Reader, whoever you may be,
God grant you found a trifle here,
Or some mistake grammatical,
To raise a smile, provoke a tear,
Some wild past your heart rehearses,
Friend or foe, it matters naught,
Farewell. Whatever it was you sought,
A glimpse of life, or a jest,
Or perhaps a pleasant rest,
Let us part now amicably,
Something of what these stanzas tell.
In this casual set of verses:
Prompt a dream, or article;
50.
My Tanya's, appeared to me,
Glowing, in a crystal sphere,
And farewell you, my true ideal,
My little book. In you, I feel,
Veiled in mist, as in a dream,
How many days since her form,
Farwell to my strange hero, too,
Sweet conversation that inspires,
I've found all that a poet desires,
And beside her, her Eugene -
A quiet retreat from the storm.
Its free flow still dark, unclear.
And you my constant care, yes you
All their romance seen dimly
51.
Ah, what treasures Fate has taken!
Closes the tale, before it's ceased,
And slips away, as chance may please,
Before he's drained life to the lees,
Alas, now some are distant,
But of those, good friends, insistent,
Blessed is he, who leaves the feast,
And hides it suddenly from view,
To whom the first few lines were read...
For my Tatyana, long forsaken...
And yet my Onegin's etched.
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
As, my Onegin, I do you.
And she, whose lines I sketched
