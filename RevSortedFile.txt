For that evening. 'She'll be there...!
And Tanya, full of terror, wakes...!
She - always she, behind the glass...!
The eye to hides its joyfulness...!
'You're married then! I'd no idea!
O, the country! O, Russia!
Your three thousand year diploma!
Substituting - belle Tatiana!
Tatyana, my dear Tatyana!
Doctors, and weeping women, dead!
Not exactly what we need!
Prematurely blighted, doomed!
Speak the reproach I have earned!
That they by Mother Earth are blessed!
How poisonous the words he used!
What traps he set for those abused!
Or else.....or else, may God forbid!
The echo of midwinter's cold!
And be as happy...as I could!
I tremble to re-read....must end!
Are enchanting, friends, I find!
Ah well, to them may God be kind!
Another day I bring to mind!
Alone, alone it seemed for good!
You fill my soul, and my blood!
In some peaceful rural place!
Moscow's a better market-place!
I hear the magic of your voice!
The colonel's sent them, so, a dance!
Galloping onwards at my side!
Oh, this stupid countryside!
'- Only the solemn choral ode!
'Who'd have though it?' - 'What an age!
Her eyes are opened, it is he!
The Enchantress, Winter: here is she!
Long hours of idle reverie!
All attentive, or just mumble!
How perfectly she plays her role!
Let us all follow his example!
You've intoxicated me in style!
Last night what a fright you gave me!
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
To crowd us out before our time!
Now at last, it's time to dine!
A shadow, pale. Ah, for one line!
God! How I erred, and am undone!
I'll return to him: no more!
From the local camp, what rapture!
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Truly his star is in eclipse!
Pine for you, and mourn your fate!
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
A poem in cantos, twenty-five!
Spring, ah Spring! The time of love!
Talks of Olga: such is love!
Silently impart love's teaching!
Save us, how well you're looking!
'I can't sleep, Nurse; it's stifling!
Opinion, keeps the whole world turning!
How utterly himself forgetting!
He visited at Christmas...Oh!
Horses' hooves and human speech!
Enough. My shoulder's from the plough!
With cruel joke, or lying oath!
Oh my frivolous lost youth!
Caricaturing him, Sen-Pri!
And with what storms his body shook!
Though she requires a madrigal!
Rank demands, achieves its goal!
Ignorance of the pain I feel!
And so we part, again farewell!
Mounts a goose's neck, a skull!
Yet he'd once set her heart awhirl!
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Long ago....It was no phantom!
A glittering stream beside a garden!
Ah, what treasures Fate has taken!
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
To Onegin. Dear God in heaven!
No mark of tears? ...No trace, no sign!
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
Moscow, I dreamed of you again!
He loves you....like your dearest kin!
To the fields, my friends! Run, run!
The ageing laurels of my crown!
'She's not in love then?' 'Tell me who!
Farwell to you, my freedom, too!
Though late, have the exordium too!
Truly? ...Yes, indeed, our hero!
And boxed you ears, a time or two!
Benediction we drank deep!
She's followed closely by the bear!
Glistening, an obedient tear!
And then such things are like a cancer!
But, what of Onegin? True, dear Reader!
Her neck, her throat, her shoulder!
Izmailov's Journal set before her!
Press on! Andryushka, quicker, quicker!
While she gazes at the cover!
To read in Russian. Ah, what horror!
Cold, darkly threatening, and dour!
Of this fickle life, my friends!
'My Grandison? ...Oh, Grandison! Yes!
In those soft seductive glances!
On earth but you my heart adores!
So our age improves us creatures!
How changed now our Tatyana is!
Verses, quarrels: ah, what dreams!
Foot it sweetly, on the grass!
Alas, not difficult to guess!
Grow paler, and then die....what bliss!
But from our friends, may God preserve us!
Where could be better? - Where there are none of us!
O rus!
Oh, farewell now, the golden days!
Seems half a heron, half a cat!
What languor fills her breast, my sweet!
An Academician in a bonnet!
Now jealousy shows its delight!
A monstrous crew, imagine it!
She, more pallid, and more silent!
Checked the sun, his watch - and went!
Like the fool I am, I clean forgot!
Again the pain, again love's art!
How swift his letters from the heart!
And sound in every Russian heart!
Burned in my dear Tanya's heart!
A gateway in a lane: at last!
Last year was it? I dandled you!
May Heaven's lightning wither you!
What we sing's not meant for you!
Tatyana was betrothed: some knew!
My services to you I vow!
Here's to my dear friend, Bordeaux!
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
Congratulate ourselves. Hurray!
All night, barely a foot away!
Ah, now but you're up already!
Where we can...' 'Oh, an elegy!
- No, nobody, assuredly!
Immerse in, so relentlessly!
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
How proud the glance you'll employ!
Took his old medal for a toy!
But on, on with my story!
Dear Lord, enough, enough! Have pity!
Know all love's treacherous devicez!
Himself! I thought: "He's the one,"
I long to sob, I long to weep...!'
My friends, in bending: 'It is I!'
'Princess, mon ange' - 'Pachette!' - 'Alina!'
To cry aloud: 'She's mine, she's mine!'
'What that fat general?' - 'He's gone!'
'Come to my golden chamber, love!'
- 'It's long since he was here though!'
Enough, it's time now to move on!'
And sang me to church. What a pair!'
'You're off again? Oh, these poets!'
'It seems he has forgotten us!'
Pronouncing: 'He was a poet!'
Were you in love? I must know!'
'Goodness how the years speed by!'
"Why the devil can't you die?"'
His son was wed not long ago,'
As being entre chien et loup,'
Perhaps the mail's caused some delay,'
Come to me, come: yours, to the end!...'
I was their neighbour.' 'Come, my friend...'
And the crowd, all the rabble...'
About the weather, crops, and cattle...'
I thank you now, with all my soul...'
He's walking off...he's sideways on...'
When I was young, a mere suggestion...'
As they composed them long ago...'
He's fooled us far too long, and so...'
Boldly trusting in your honour...'
Will slyly whisper, grinning fools...'
Old age is pain and wretchedness...'
'Of course not darling, only say...'
Is speaking? See, she's wearing red.'
What might result: 'Ever prepared.'
'What's to be done? She's not a child.'
'Ah, boredom, that's what's bad, my friend.'
Red as a poppy, your bright face.'
To rest, beneath the woodland shade.'
Rest, poet, from your pilgrimage.'
Would chase me about, fit to die.'
Open the window then sit by me.'
The nurse. 'It's love. Leave me alone.'
She'll brood, or roam the woods alone.'
All hope, all you who enter here.'
The master often brooded there.'
Blessed the tomb's darkness there.'
Didelot too is quite the bore.'
On the next page let them write.'
I'm...Nurse, you see...I'm in love.'
'My dear Onegin, you're yawning.'
Past six, Onegin will be waiting.'
Introduce me.' 'Now, you're jesting.'
Goodbye, Eugene, I must be leaving.'
Today, it is my turn to speak.'
It's bound at least to make me ill.'
Shall not fade before its term.'
Come, borrow from me, within reason.'
- 'You know him then?' - 'Well, yes and no.'
He is a man of honour too.'
'And she's?' - 'A Larin, and a dear.'
Farewell, lonely sanctuaries.'
The foolish horizon honours.'
Though he can't bring me happiness.'
They'd welcome you with great delight.'
To sleep later. Now goodnight.'
'I don't see what's so bad about it.'
I'll leave the verdict up to you.'
And will be faithful to my vow.'
My sweet child, as God is holy.'
Nurse, I'm bored, tell me a story.'
I can't count them if I try.'
'And tell me, which was Tatyana?'
Child, is there something you need?'
Be so enslaved, so cruel, so blind?'
Zaretsky asked, 'is your second?'
'Could I, perhaps, just see inside?'
Suits the likes of you and me?'
Oh God, what must he think of me?'
Darling, how long can you stay here?'
Killing the hours dozing there?'
What future does fate hold in store?'
She gazes earnestly: 'What's wrong?'
Do you recall your Grandison?'
Your Olga, how's Tatyana too?'
My husband's folk...do you hear?'
'Tell me will your friend appear?'
'Can you really love the younger?'
'Qu'�crirez-vous sur ces tablettes?'
You fritter away your evenings?'
Whom did your dream reveal to you?'
'Shall I live to see that day?'
'Where's Anisya with the key?'
In the eyes of our society?'
As though she had a private sorrow'
Perhaps too (oh, flattering hope!)
I can't translate that, as I live!)
And then she squeaks (Oh Lord, above!)
Preventing them from doing wrong!)
Take it then, since you're so eager!)
Though some of us are born to range.)
Though why, I can hardly tell.)
I love you (why should I pretend?)
About time too! (I hear you say?)
Or else (all joking aside)
Believe me (conscience is my guide)
(The place where we began, you see)
Would soon settle his new wife)
I thought I'd paint (See Chapter One)
Our days of youth, now past and done)
(That I'd once happily rehearse)
Melds fascination with alarm)
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
With the springtime showers again)
Herself not certain of the reason)
So people (I openly confess)
(Both are perhaps synonymous)
(Likenesses too, of this and that)
Yet (as all rules exceptions boast)
(Like love's young dream, another jest)
With his offspring on display)
(Mechanically, as they say)
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
(Critics stern, acute as any)
My hearts ablaze, I cried: 'It's he',
'Yet', he reflects, 'I must save her',
The wretched wreath of elegy (sic),
It's wretched (I trust you'll agree),
(To say nothing of our verse),
Until (a wealth of thanks conceive),
(Cursing the hour of his birth),
Unsuitable for girls to hear),
To pair Yevgeny and I,
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
And Dunya sits to pour the tea,
Sometimes he read to Olga,
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Enthral like Martin Zadeka,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Sad as Zhukovsky's Svetlana,
Haunted by love's pain, Tatyana,
Can this really be Tatyana,
The girls are stowed with Tatyana,
They sit across from our Tatyana,
But she takes fright, my Tatyana,
Her sister's name was...Tatyana,
Boldly replacing its belle Nina,
Long ago, Princess Alina,
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Along with Cottin's work Malvina,
The nurse, old Filipevna,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
And captive girls by the Salgira,
Reader, I'll enhance the vista,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
The Cleopatra of the Neva,
Yet you'll agree I hope, that diva,
Lensky, Tanya's; Kharlikova,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
Beside fair Nina Voronskaya,
Alone and sad, my darling Tanya,
Quite rarefied, review my Tanya,
Then how did you come to wed?' 'Tanya,
It was God's will now, my Vanya,
With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
All of that ancient rhetoric,
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
Read Fontenelle. He was eclectic,
The casual, the idealistic,
Saw nothing good, predicted bad,
Find life a ritual, dull and dead,
And full of grief that he was dead,
With tumult in his heart and head,
But still found nothing in his head,
The Prince, amused, turns his head,
The formal dinners stretch ahead,
Novel that you choose to read,
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
With a Persian fabric spread,
In attic too. Eugene, instead,
Kind and sober, now, instead,
Over the darkened stones instead,
Enough. It's high time that instead,
Gave himself to it instead,
In every sorrow that she had,
And draw to us a handsome lad,
The fleas at halts drive you mad,
The secrets of the marriage bed,
Midst swarms of children, lie in bed,
Tatyana takes herself to bed,
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
Vision, standing by my bed,
So, often, while he's still abed,
When all of Petersburg's abed,
Asks him, 'yesterday? Disturbed,
As a veteran, solemn faced,
A cherub, motionless, red-faced,
Considering himself, so placed,
Yawning the while as he raced,
No, for his early feelings faded,
The manor house was quite secluded,
The sky with autumn's breath is clouded,
Screened by the hills when storms intruded,
He almost lost his mind, indeed,
It's for Onegin.' - 'Yes, indeed,
A charming portrait, yes, indeed,
Some claimed the marriage was agreed,
'Where, oh where have you vanished,
By chance, I have the lines, unfinished,
Rise and ripen, briefly nourished,
And hurriedly, before it died,
The next room too; unoccupied,
Instead we see, her sash untied,
Bullets are loaded, weapons cocked,
And he then rapidly skedaddled,
Or force them to be reconciled,
Though privately they'd be reviled,
A needle, never once excelled,
Hears, and then his heart is chilled,
Killed before his promise bloomed,
Saw nothing through the tears that glistened,
Or on a page some other's signed,
A soul for passion's fires designed,
Her manner is as self-contained,
Her head above the silk inclined,
Is here at last, the journey planned,
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
For Boston, claiming the old-fashioned,
Those keenest to take part are summoned,
On the flowers, their eyes quite red,
And spoke as if he scarcely cared,
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
In his twenties, a dandy bred,
His stallion, a Don thoroughbred,
The visit, a note he proffered,
Where I've loved, where I've suffered,
That year, the autumn lingered,
When passions' flames have wavered,
With purer inspiration fired,
Prince Vyazemsky, Muse-inspired,
The noble elegies you've sired,
Over a game of chess they pored,
Their steaming cups, have barely stirred,
That washed its face, and purred,
When but a boy his heart was captured,
Closes the tale, before it's ceased,
Beat the servant girls and cursed,
Perhaps her nurse, if she'd been blessed,
And by Heaven has been blessed,
By melancholy tears oppressed,
That Hussar, Pykhtin, she confused,
At ill-bred men he deprecated,
Killed the flies, and rusticated,
The old ones utterly out-dated,
They cross themselves, grace is repeated,
Like that by Delvig's muse created,
Perhaps for glory he was created,
From every pleasure he retreated,
The jagged flints once firmly seated,
Perhaps that lyre, to silence fated,
To what their mistresses were fated,
At every single thing he hated,
Lensky is overjoyed, elated,
And her youthful charms, elated,
As well-read, but opinionated,
But for his wit, which he rated,
Epiphany they celebrated,
To whom our hearts were consecrated,
The new ones simply antiquated,
He was quite infatuated,
As servants of the Muse have acted,
All evening Lensky was distracted,
They find her strange, somewhat affected,
As a girl's thoughts, unaffected,
He sang of love, to love subjected,
To his Tatyana, though rejected,
He undresses; a book's selected,
Though you're a spouse respected,
Reader, you've guessed, as I suspected,
Unfashionable, but that's expected,
Yet the most loyal, it's expected,
Resolute, impatient, waited,
Love's sweet crown so long awaited,
When suddenly they're visited,
At first the neighbours visited,
Besides, my friend, you're invited,
Alas, poor Yorick!' he lamented,
'In his arms I played, contented,
Within, a rural landscape painted,
One with which she's acquainted,
That your pencils were all blunted,
The old mother, broken-hearted,
Not long before, tender-hearted,
The Muse he might well have deserted,
Settled, to married life converted,
These hours that fate has plotted,
Always unjustly persecuted,
In kindred souls too he believed,
Over my urn, and think: "He loved,
But Tanya's spirit is unmoved,
For teeth or nails, both are served,
And at the table, dinner served,
He hoped Olga and I would wed,
'Olga's younger, yet she's wed,
His thirties, profitably wed,
To bear on things we've all eschewed,
As in the olden days they flowed,
There such freedoms are allowed,
Is it the same plan he once followed,
And here is autumn golden-browed,
As an air from Weber's Freisch�tz played,
Yet left Eugene, alone, dismayed,
On the far heights, where he strayed,
The breath on her lips is glazed,
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
The corpse on a table laid,
Beside the fire a table's laid,
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
For my Zaretsky, as I said,
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Recalling all the good he did,
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
As pure as winter's ice, as rigid,
His vein then was dark and languid,
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Unfathomable, even to the bold,
I've known women, proud and cold,
In the sound, and silence cold,
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Once master had no need to scold,
Christmas comes, joys unfold,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
Like yours my darling, made to hold,
On what the state relies, he told,
To blow his brains out, as we're told,
And that fugitive from the world,
Both the sisters, by the hand,
That's not the business we've in hand,
My rhyming novel's well in hand,
These varied chapters in your hand,
Each with a pistol in his hand,
Motionless and nerveless hand,
Firmly founded on the land,
He left his village and his land,
Lets him draw her to dry land,
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
The fields, the woods, that silent stand,
Re-upholstered, there they stand,
First Madame, you understand,
And jealousy, you understand,
Invite her home, too, in the end,
All make for home in the end,
Bored with leisure in the end,
Always faithful to the end,
Awaits us all, at the end,
Who met with an untimely end,
Where Italy's gold nights descend,
Voice of lover, foe and friend,
A fatal wound on some young friend,
Friend of my heart, eternal friend,
Squeeze her hand, kiss their friend,
His story) having killed his friend,
In the album of some sweet friend,
Her sing-song voice in gossip blend,
Attention to her album: find,
While fated everywhere to find,
To leave a name for fate to find,
Of pure respect, followed behind,
He leaves a tender verse behind,
She dare not stop, or look behind,
The world; the ball, are left behind,
Adding to albums of that kind,
Dispel my doubts, I am blind,
There's no escape, in her sad mind,
Can you, with such a heart and mind,
Them often feign a change of mind,
The fancies of a foolish mind,
Them both, but no one knew her mind,
That Olga occupies his mind,
A fiery will, a lively mind,
Hospitable, a family grind,
But you, the suspect volumes bound,
And waking early, Tanya found,
Where he's no longer to be found,
Of criticism, most profound,
Ready to praise us or to hound,
Stiffening, as his friends stand round,
She recovers, gazes round,
While they chew. All around,
And not the least ink-stain around,
To watch him lying on the ground,
Leaving his tea and rum aground,
In secret regions underground,
Strikes for the poet, at the sound,
Diverted by the welcome sound,
Why not? It has a pleasant sound,
Behind a door cheers resound,
Aren't you bored to death, dear God,
Token of every beauty, good,
Commands us to reject for good,
To our poetic brotherhood,
Time was when she would write, in blood,
Or to whom we send a card,
Tanya downcast, as if she heard,
At least, denoting our regard,
Deep in thought, above the board,
And recreate the magic hoard,
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Is sleeping soundly: in the yard,
He sends a second and a third,
His seat at the clavichord,
With parting, vengeance with a word,
Subtle, acute, and, in a word,
At some soire where...not a word,
Of guests arriving brought the word,
Too often by a foreign word,
The classic mask, the trumpet, sword,
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
And now the north wind drives the cloud,
Enough of praise though for the proud,
For whom among that jealous crowd,
As such fine mansions ought to be,
Reader, whoever you may be,
Of rationality and peace,
'Farewell now, you haunts of peace,
Pretty yes, with that round face,
Makes his way, with corpselike face,
And as a rule despised each face,
With some fair Venetian face,
In all her person, form or face,
Breath of spring caress my face,
Now like some deserted place,
In his songs kept pride of place,
The green card-tables are in place,
To ready himself, have all in place,
At the table takes her place,
Would condemn me in that place,
She quickens her despairing pace,
So far away in time and space,
As the foolish moon in space,
Across a gentlemanly space,
With shadows all its gloomy space,
Into the lobby's empty space,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
Though he knew the human race,
Powdery furrows as they race,
The two old women weep, embrace,
Float in a gondola's embrace,
Immortals clasped in fate's embrace,
To show intelligence and grace,
Nonchalantly, full of grace,
Or whist, that's never out of grace,
He never managed to disgrace,
I see your fretting's left no trace,
Extends, and tries the gleaming ice,
Two slender boughs glued by ice,
Our minds are full of prejudice,
There a minister, out of office,
Un-blighted by the world's cold malice,
To make the soul of man rejoice,
His memoirs to an empty coppice,
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
And of his every caprice,
Let's surround him, in a trice,
Slithers, and slips, in a trice,
Taking her nurse's fond advice,
I marvelled at their arrogance,
When we met, long ago, by chance,
Lightly at the lines, by chance,
Yet revealing in his glance,
Iron virtue, chilly glance,
No pride, and no chilly glance,
Meet my hero of romance,
For that fatal sustenance,
Listening with tolerance,
The young girls dream, in a trance,
Relinquished his inheritance,
I've not the strength for repentance,
Content with life, took a stance,
Fired by longing, circumstance,
I dared not trust the circumstance,
No pretension in her advance,
How languid was his reticence,
Filled with grace and innocence,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
Of shy provincial innocence,
Go seeking quarrels, take offence,
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
Then he bowed to her, in silence,
Though, in her indifference,
How many follies in its presence,
In an instant, with this pretence,
French still entrances in a sentence,
Then, at Zaretsky's insistence,
To a bachelor's sad existence,
Humbly living out existence,
How passionate his eloquence,
Still the throbbing is fierce,
Her love thus, since, despite its force,
The cue's abandoned, half-lights fade,
She wanders, purposeless, a shade,
Found his place, or, martyred shade,
Filled with sweet passion, pensive shade,
Deepening the garden's shade,
Or the lime-tree alley's shade,
Never having felt love's blade,
Backward, I glance. Farewell the glade,
For a few books, a garden glade,
At the unexpected move he'd made,
We sing those who, fortunes made,
Shovelling silver with a spade,
The noise, the glare, the masquerade,
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
And in a sing-song voice confide,
Then, the year through, we can hide,
Then proud ladies, see her glide,
A block of snow will slowly glide,
So: Madame Larina, while we ride,
Brooding silently, she'll ride,
Like pale Lenore, in moonlit ride,
Our great language, in its pride,
My flighty mistress and my pride,
The crescent moon, at her left side,
And, seated quietly by my side,
Beside a river. On every side,
Visits to at Christmas-tide,
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
Stretched the pastures far and wide,
Another door, he flings it wide,
Once he heard, near his abode,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Their carriage wheels, briskly rode,
Been spared this deep inquietude,
To whom in rural solitude,
In the world's noise, or solitude,
Like lost fading echoes flee,
Perhaps by some divine decree,
I must give her letter, error-free,
At fifty tolerably debt-free,
The heavenly drink, you'd agree,
The fruits of learning's golden tree,
Her little finger's traced, I see,
This letter here, don't you see,
As long as, on credit, they'd guarantee,
He'd led a good and simple life,
Then Lensky falls, robbed of life,
In every vicissitude of life,
Found refuge from the storm of life,
Her days and nights alone, through life,
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Content forever with their life,
All the sad morning of his life,
Then truly, in this life,
Forgetting friends and city life,
Yevgeny swiftly grasps a knife,
At lies with which the press was rife,
And in the fierce storm and strife,
Plants cabbages, and free from strife,
A household, a neglected wife,
Found, without rank, career, or wife,
With his relations and his wife,
By your good and virtuous wife,
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Women of a certain age,
And since he never read a page,
In bonnets, roses, all the rage,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
Possessed of the poet's finer rage,
Diviner, and Chaldean sage,
Fit only for our grandsire's stage,
On any fond face on this stage,
In one a ledger taken hostage,
A delicate and trembling ridge,
Stretched across to form a bridge,
Now is the moment of revenge,
Enchantment fails such men as he,
The gloomy eccentric, where is he,
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
Heels, and leaps, and long moustache,
Her same friend Monsieur Finemouche,
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
Just anyhow and let him lie,
You, phantoms born of reverie,
Lost in the depths of reverie,
Recited, as in reverie,
Plunged endlessly in reverie,
Lost in her own deep reverie,
Her dearest friend was reverie,
Enough to make the ballroom shake,
A walk beside the lonely lake,
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
Lensky, keen to avoid mistake,
At the mazurka, floors would quake,
While weary servants half-awake,
An empty phantom, or a joke,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
For two long minutes neither spoke,
The history of the passing gale,
With that my readers I'll regale,
The cattle low; a nightingale,
Of smoke scarce visible, soft, pale,
Hidden from the world: while pale,
Beside which Chateaubriand's pale,
The veteran is stirred, grows pale,
Then nature trembles, deathly pale,
I might try to tell the whole tale,
Some profoundly moral tale,
No fear and menace in my tale,
Tanya believed in every tale,
Or end a letter with vale,
China and bronzes fill the table,
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
In all, not unacceptable,
'Oh there'll be no end of babble,
'Then happiness seemed possible,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
Our neglected bridges crumble,
Anywhere, start, end, or middle,
Lines too short, long, or a riddle,
To show themselves, twirl, and jingle,
Timidly, once in a while,
His mind, still malleable the while,
Thinking of Eugene, all the while,
The world received her with a smile,
He heard our Lensky with a smile,
Like rose-red lips without a smile,
In decent company, and smile,
Encouraged by his Olga's smile,
A simple letter, free of guile,
With witticisms forged with guile,
Without a hint of hate or guile,
Russian without such faults is vile,
Resolved to hate the false, the fickle,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Was revealed, recorded whole,
Is found disturbing, on the whole,
And played an honourable role,
And played a wholly different role,
Like the poet's life as simple,
Who with radiant light would wrestle,
The hand no longer drives the cattle,
To the spinning-wheel's low rattle,
Tea, and jam, and endless prattle,
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Whom Epicurean maxims rule,
Then they're off again in style,
Tayana's letter's here before me,
What has all that to do with me,
She'd visit every spot with me,
The cards, and play whist with me,
I'm muddled now!'... 'But Nurse, tell me,
H'm! My valued Reader, tell me,
That stirs dark epigrams within me,
And in Caucasian gorges, join me,
My Tanya's, appeared to me,
In quiet, did you not speak to me,
And yet how sad you seem to me,
Your candour: that is dear to me,
All poets, it seems to me,
Or a decent fellow - you or me,
Have wandered far enough, for me,
I too recall....ah, not for me,
Of the poet, this world forget me,
You might enjoy it, so allow me,
But back now to our theme: Madame,
At tea too sweet, banal Madame,
Obtaining wealth, and rank, and fame,
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Both had wearied of the game,
No flavour of the social game,
The fear of error, and of shame,
Burning suddenly with shame,
Open myself to endless blame,
The glow of the poetic flame,
Like stone and water, ice and flame,
In both our hearts a dying flame,
That thirst for truth, toil's midnight flame,
She halts, as if scorched by flame,
Her breast heaves, her cheeks aflame,
On him, when he heard his name,
I love a friendly glass, the same,
Into the shadows, still the same,
Touching lightly on each theme,
Her eyes: the bell towers chime,
But summer in our northern clime,
Age demands prose for a time,
And wake her many and many a time,
Has met his fate before his time,
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
'A story, Tanya? In my time,
Estimable Reader: come,
Of park and palace, spire and dome,
Every salon high and handsome,
Watching the molten wax assume,
Exhausted by regret, and rhyme,
He's lost: the votary of rhyme,
From passing thought, enduring rhyme,
I knew scores and scores, in rhyme,
Like modern verse, our empty rhyme,
Breathing on the icy pane,
As the shadows slowly wane,
I painted over this sad scene,
Through the fashionable scene,
Scene after dull, exhausting scene,
Aware that Lensky and Eugene,
The Princess gazes at Eugene,
And there, where bold Melpomene,
So unapproachable, serene,
His three roans in a troika. Fine,
Before the young man's death, he'd dine,
And though a womaniser fine,
To me - joyous things that shine,
Life without albums, waists, Pauline,
Alas, excessive) and the wine,
A bottle of sparkling wine,
Concerning harvesting, or wine,
Smoky bottles, tarred with twine,
Yet ours, though he may be one,
His wife was quite another one,
Though not indeed that she was one,
A poet? No, he wasn't one,
And quiet her voice: 'Have done,
He waits till the mazurka's done,
In your traces: now youth's done,
Indifferently, the game is done,
Morning comes: the dark is done,
And then, while you were gone,
He leaves again, and home has gone,
Wish, dream, regret for what was gone,
Tatyana's bloom is all but gone,
A flower in deepest grass, alone,
On her balcony, alone,
An exile, and bound to none,
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Always partly out of tune,
Clear and serene his tune,
Sliding on ice, with his worn shoe,
She rushes to him, on tiptoe,
Some fool may yet achieve a trope,
And curious as young girls are,
His heart the tempest now stripped bare,
He's pining, with heart laid bare,
Birch, and lime, and aspen bare,
Dog-eared, with the cover bare,
As some deceit the eye lays bare,
Blessed the day of toil and care,
I'll go, I'll go' - At once, with care,
In the margins where, with care,
Onegin spoke of them with care,
Sentimental, free from care,
She seems to neither see nor care,
Love yourself, your only care,
She feels are things she should share,
- 'Not at all.' - 'Well, I declare,
On the far bank, the smoky flare,
Repay him: and with joyful stare,
If she met, all unaware,
Yet, should you succeed, beware,
She stumbles on - and yet, beware,
As dazzling as a flashing sabre,
Don't disavow it, I find here,
His daily round I'll describe here,
God grant you found a trifle here,
The bear speaks: 'Friends live here,
Farewell! No lingering here,
Into Olga's album here,
And seems an utter alien here,
It's plain that he's the master here,
Glowing, in a crystal sphere,
Tanya watches the moon's sphere,
To a frail bed in a corner, there,
The Spanish ambassador, there,
A fisherman's fire: Tanya there,
She left, yet still Eugene stood there,
For the simple churchyard there,
His friend for his own presence there,
The door flies open, Olga's there,
Through the hall, our hero's there,
Round the carriage, she was there,
Nothing touched his feelings there,
Of its inscription, feel pity there,
Our old modest dwelling, where,
His thoughts were lingering elsewhere,
And, mist on meadows everywhere,
Imbued with true poetic fire,
In a corner, by the fire,
At home, impatient, breathing fire,
Slowly, by his slumbering fire,
Poor Tatyana was on fire,
Waiting there, her cheeks on fire,
They're never worth the singer's fire,
Despite her beauty bright as fire,
The double windows, cosy fire,
And end, himself, in the mire,
Her idol, someone to admire,
Is the blood-sucking Vampire,
Then disenchantment, bored desire,
Pure devotion his desire,
That our Yevgeny found a bore,
Then play a note or two before,
Love my hero, as before,
Carry the weapons, as before,
To speak about the night before,
Where only fair Terpsichore,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
How often to the Tauric shore,
Beside that nameless river shore,
There beside the Neva's shore,
Perhaps you've seen, on Neva's shore,
It's time to leave this tedious shore,
An illustrator's dream, and more,
His leave, his heart crushed, once more,
Vladimir shuts the book once more,
He pursues, or something more,
At least their words seeming more,
Tasting the crowd's idle pleasure,
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Was bored again beyond all measure,
She quietly took her husband's measure,
Gives us the first snow's measure,
For wilful passion was my measure,
I treat it as a sacred treasure,
The clamour of a wake; unsure,
Two hearts, some flowers, a torch assure,
(Since, fond of contradiction, Nature,
The power to rule, in every feature,
Who in this calm, majestic creature,
Fluff her hair to suit, dear creature,
And soon reveal their better nature,
His heart forever burned with rapture,
Beyond my importunate lyre,
The world he wandered with his lyre,
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Gazing at the glowing pyre,
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
When their unbridled stirrings cease,
May this, my epic, if you please,
Silent, chattering, as you please,
And slips away, as chance may please,
Her heartache feels like some disease,
A hymn can reach, or people's praise,
Apuleius won my praise,
Eugene came to apologise,
That instant, and not recognise,
The merchant and the beggar rise,
For capture again, should that arise,
'But where on earth,' with surprise,
All are watching in surprise,
Show neither anger nor surprise,
Turn to her; and every guise,
The useful arts, can devise,
Of despair, burn flattery's incense,
But only a yard, strange, immense,
What are they? I could dispense,
At first they make but little sense,
And there grew wild as they: all sense,
Here no conscience, there no sense,
A sprinkling of commonsense,
Her silent passion's more intense,
Neither pedantic nor intense,
At this Zaretsky promptly rose,
Lowered eyes their gleams eclipse,
At nothing, pathway, lake, or copse,
Tend his roses, and rehearse,
Will often food and drink rehearse,
The praise the endless tides rehearse,
Conceit of elegiac verse,
Retired, to write undying verse,
Books of sentimental verse,
The best dog, Dasher: he's the horse,
Exits, calls loudly for his horse,
Gripped by feelings of remorse,
At once he's tortured by remorse,
Tatyana had no doll to nurse,
You'll often have seen, of course,
His fingers frostbitten of course,
He curses woman's reckless course,
But you, disciple of the Muse,
Nor hours given to the Muse,
Join me and my capricious Muse,
You acted rightly, in my cause,
Gone, with the fashions we abuse,
Aunts and mothers keeping house,
This unrewarding t�te � t�te,
Zaretsky, once a reprobate,
Of fashions always out of date,
Will at some far distant date,
This house, the soires, my whole fate,
Might have met the usual fate,
Some stanza, preserved by fate,
Is carried far from her by fate,
The servants gather by the gate,
This tinsel of a life I hate,
Are heard, perverse, insatiate,
He saw the poor girl's quivering state,
They held to, in their peaceful state,
So, Reader, in that sorry state,
Was in fact a fine estate,
Newly arrived on his estate,
Before you, simply to excite,
The East is indolently white,
The very girl, he'd kept her note,
Yet now, receiving Tanya's note,
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
The tender style in which she wrote,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
It's true we don't possess good taste,
And everything Parisian taste,
Garbed to the modern taste,
In agitation, his lorgnette,
Left the cradle, play flirt, coquette,
Tatyana is no cool coquette,
And godly folk will institute,
From Griboedov took Chatzky's cue,
From my words take warning due,
Words that flowed from my tongue,
Of sky-blue eyes, a heavenly blue,
She lights the North: 'Now, tell me true,
However I wished to prove true,
To Champagne I'm no longer true,
My days are numbered, yet it's true,
She was no beauty, that is true,
Seduced like our ancestor Eve,
Your forbearance now I'll crave,
By the serpent who'll deceive,
His dressing room, I'll not deceive,
Surely, then, you can forgive,
And clog the Larin's steps and drive,
As neighbouring families arrive,
Then what an epic I'll contrive,
A light dinner, not too pensive,
A lively horse and responsive,
Its use to date is not excessive,
I love the word, it's so expressive,
Not cold at all, yet not effusive,
Calm, her gestures unobtrusive,
You may consider unattractive,
And praised to the skies above,
You may trust through storms above,
- 'Oh my child, Heavens above,
Drains his glass then, Heavens above,
Perched on a lyre a little dove,
Her confidante, her own sweet dove,
And you, familiar woods I love,
Considered as the art of love,
A tomb, a Cyprian shrine to love,
The ally she was born to love,
Of course, a tender beauty's love,
To flee the place; She cannot move,
For long? ...Forever. For we,
When on the porch they said goodbye,
The mile-markers soothe the eye,
Our Tanya, no discerning eye,
Watching its flight with anxious eye,
Squints, half-closes his left eye,
Five versts from Krasnogorye,
Faced with her open, tender gaze,
Jealousy gone, and anger's blaze,
Flares in her face, those eyes ablaze,
Standing there, his eyes ablaze,
News from town, the latest craze,
Drunk as an owl, a Frenchman's prize,
That distance, quencher of belief,
Part liveried ranks, to bring relief,
      There, where days are cloudy and brief,
Ever habitual pain and grief,
Nothing else could end her grief,
In peaked cap, hair full of fluff,
The French cuisine's finest proof,
A windmill dances a wild jig,
Asked her name, straightened his wig,
Her father saw no harm in reading,
Her, while to her ear confiding,
I'll recall the words of longing,
I've learnt to know another longing,
The joy and pain she's cherishing,
The hall is crowded, shoving, pushing,
Could never yet conceal a thing,
Challenge that, but here's the thing,
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
Ready to faint, alas, poor thing,
Or a hare trembles, hapless thing,
No one is there, beyond its seething,
Dreaming, understanding nothing,
This perpetual sterile talking,
Wine by the bottle, never blinking,
A mason, and forever drinking,
With some nonsense while your drinking,
Lensky, wealthy and good-looking,
The dogs run towards her, barking,
A noisy crowd; and fighting, larking,
Cries: 'Cease your endless squawking,
While reading, on both mind and feeling,
A Horse Guard's spurs go jingling,
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Carried away by his brave calling,
See, my early bird, my darling,
Motionless, like one dreaming,
Blood from his wound is streaming,
It glows and hisses, softly steaming,
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
In the doorway, idly preening,
Picking berries in the evening,
Accounts, drink, rage, the gloomy evening,
In the silent misty evening,
Her dreams had long since set her yearning,
In solitude her heart was burning,
The new-born sun, the day is dawning,
Honouring, where they lay sleeping,
Then too, with fervent weeping,
Where Thalia is quietly napping,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
He pens, though she seems uncaring,
His illness makes him more daring,
Like a doe seen in a clearing,
While the breakfast is preparing,
Began an aimless wandering,
Revive. Two words, a whispering,
Orchestra already tiring,
Melancholy, wild, retiring,
'A habit Lensky.' 'You find life boring,
Heated by the warmth of spring,
Of another, older spring,
For it's our idol, honour's mainspring,
But later found it re-assuring,
Enters. The room is gyring,
It is of my young friend, I sing,
For Tanya, a song that children sing,
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
And I'll mention here, in passing,
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Overwhelmed, near suffocating,
Love's violent pains, heart's beating,
Onegin without hesitating,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Utter a few words of greeting,
At home they're already waiting,
Turned to the envoy, mutely waiting,
As if before some mournful parting,
Popping corks, and idle feasting,
This Phyllis, who's so interesting,
To beat once more its rainbow wing,
The wit of former days displaying,
Tatyana, in the darkness lying,
At my mistress's feet lying,
Oh, you should have heard me crying,
Their fathers saw them marrying,
With passion's fire she is blazing,
Wooed by all that ardent throng,
Vladimir thought him quite wrong,
A clever scheme of rural song,
Listen to our secret song,
A song we love, a merry song,
Had never, even when young,
Blessed is he, who in youth was young,
Who, as the years went by unsung,
I offered little interest...ah,
Each day he stands beside her coach,
His mind ignores all self-reproach,
When we see our lad approach,
Motivation, action, speech,
The poet's bold impassioned speech,
To don a mask, in form and speech,
Didn't they mutilate our speech,
Bark, laugh, whistle, sing and screech,
Sad-eyed there, sits on a bench,
The same husband, the same pooch,
Placing it carefully in the sleigh,
Along the Neva in his sleigh,
Sang the maid on mountain high,
Dressed at dawn, she gives a sigh,
Tatyana moans then gives a sigh,
Our Tanya, not without a sigh,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
At last she gave a sudden sigh,
A second quarrel, then they sigh,
The flower has faded from the bough,
Today...no wreath hangs on the bough,
That, search all Russia though,
His calculating neighbour though,
Rides off. A pair of pistols though,
Tatyana (Russian through and through,
But hear my confession through,
As some old squire cuts a dash,
But first what hopes you'll cherish,
Whom we are obliged to cherish,
My dear one you're doomed to perish,
Onegin begins to languish,
Turning meadowland to marsh,
In his face the pains of death,
Hearing his last failing breath,
Or to examine her at length,
Tatyana flies, as swift as faith,
To pride; he's first to drink her health,
A classicist, and pedant both,
Or less: what role? Perhaps Melmoth,
While the spouse, knowing her worth,
Free, and in the flower of youth,
In the first bright flower of youth,
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
Had betrayed itself in youth,
Love, or hate, it shouts the truth,
Vexation? Vanity? Or, in truth,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
Was with Tatyana, not, in truth,
Hourly we betrayed its truth,
Or chondria, when we Russians speak,
No one listens, they just speak,
Be in your presence, hear you speak,
It seems to him that it must break,
A Muscovite in Childe Harold's cloak,
Across the literary stack,
A Kalmuck, in a ragged smock,
Diana's breast or Flora's cheek,
The cause of which it's time to seek,
To see you but once a week,
Fizzing, and amidst the talk,
Blue columns rising over folk,
Lightly sketched, with wash and ink,
The aunts, unsure what to think,
Nudge each other, slyly wink,
Till Lensky, with abstracted look,
Achieved in her conceited look,
His frail appearance, wasted look,
Shadowy woods and crystal brook,
Pleasant to see it hit the mark,
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
Freed now of its dampened cork,
Or some mistake grammatical,
His spirit egotistical,
On the page, on the word ideal,
And farewell you, my true ideal,
I'd find in you my heart's ideal,
Find that youthful folly real,
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
Ever Love's most alluring vial,
A sight of the true original,
He chose - a more than worthy goal,
He liked debate, to point a moral,
You rustic Priams, elemental,
And so grew old, like all things mortal,
Knowing all our joy is mortal,
Its fate in death's gaping portal,
Through the grave's gloomy portal,
My little book. In you, I feel,
A devil in pride, or yet an angel,
Are you then my guardian angel,
Cunningly begin a quarrel,
Louder and louder grows the quarrel,
Keen to avoid her, before the duel,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Then in the crowd inside that hovel,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel,
The imprint of his fingernail,
To follow him, pursued the trail,
You're curious for every detail,
Spring calls you to the fertile soil,
Warmth, growth and outdoor toil,
As some suspicious aged devil,
Yet wretched the man who foresees all,
Cannot but despise it all,
O country life! I like you all,
May I never meet, at a ball,
Better to hurry to the ball,
The old crone comes at their call,
Of leaves that vanished in the fall,
Prompting something steeped in gall,
Flies to the house, through the hall,
Ushers Tanya through the hall,
The crowd spills into the hall,
Still hold half the world in thrall,
To the magic bow in thrall,
Was he from Heaven or from Hell,
In this fashionable monk's cell,
Mastered I've no time to tell,
One thing alone he studied well,
Though in exchange he took as well,
She shivers as if she were ill,
The poet's soul from every ill,
Of whom she could not get her fill,
There is a stream, and here a hill,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
Then take his way, despite the chill,
Another dream, and one more chill,
Whose heart, experienced, grown chill,
In society's toils that kill,
Borrow your bewitching skill,
Derzhavin, at the grave's dark sill,
All is silent, shuttered, still,
She finds all unfamiliar, still,
The fight is done, the sword is still,
Read, thus, sundry Russians still,
Scattered reams with flying quill,
Translate my Tanya, with a will,
And in his hut, with a will,
But now her reason and her will,
No longer even stirred his will,
He drinks - the creatures howl and swill,
The child with her obedient doll,
No, passion took no greater toll,
However much it takes its toll,
Stale gossip, news, of that they're full,
Prepares herself for protocol,
Second: the poet might be a fool,
You acolytes of Levshin's school,
Yevgeny should have shown control,
His hand to Olga, leads the girl,
Detesting all the social whirl,
Gazes unseeing at the swirl,
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
Always humble, always truthful,
Sits a crayfish; wonderful,
The conversation of the powerful,
Could alter Lensky's loyal soul,
And whatever stirs her soul,
As emptiness possessed his soul,
That sad protest in his soul,
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
A scholar, in a yellow shawl,
But, lighted by Diana's gleam,
And its attendant rivulets gleam,
To where the silent shallows gleam,
Veiled in mist, as in a dream,
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
Return; that innocent, her dream,
To find her passion, and her dream,
Is turned to silver. From it's dream,
Always the one pure constant dream,
Levels the borders of the stream,
He plunged, head first, into the stream,
We'll take the trail towards the stream,
Through the borders, gains the stream,
Ever desire's habitual stream,
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Steel bits and traces flecked with foam,
But our Onegin's off to roam,
The seal with her monogram,
It's clear they're not eating them,
Laugh at whatever tickles them,
Happier he who never knew them,
Not yet attempting to aim,
Too dark for driving some would claim,
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Runs to his friend, gazes at him,
Swiftly, she flew to meet him,
Light as air, ran to greet him,
Taught him everything by whim,
'Do tell me, Prince, now, to whom,
Here was fashion's finest bloom,
Side by side, in the gloom,
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
Crushed by adolescent gloom,
Dawn breaks in a chilly gloom,
Grows recklessly and fills the room,
He'd wander through a drawing room,
The vault of heaven. Near her room,
The faces seen in every room,
Damask in the drawing-room,
Never pursue a phantom,
To rescue it, as is his custom,
Entered, together, arm in arm,
Light flashes; Eugene lifts his arm,
Yet she found a secret charm,
And guaranteed not to alarm,
How many days since her form,
Recall the sea before a storm,
Admire the dense and noisy hum,
Had she solved the conundrum,
Gentle Reader: low and mean,
Take domesticity to mean,
Handsome, young, a Kantian,
Or two, the age drawn with �lan,
Marry their daughter, was the plan,
I've sketched the underlying plan,
His nature, comprehend the man,
She does not try to raise the man,
The careful spouse as much his man,
'My uncle, what a worthy man,
The less we show our love to woman,
Now our Eugene's a countryman,
Me, or understand my moan,
Poet of the Giaour and Don Juan,
Seeing nothing there to gladden,
Gazes at the empty garden,
I too cast off the social burden,
As tedious phantoms? Is that spleen,
There was no trace to be seen,
Once, it's golden bubbles seen,
Among the wives and daughters seen,
Whose soul was formed in G�ttingen,
In my nomadic exile, then,
Bringing boredom, anguish, then,
Go, little book: find Neva then,
How I envied the waves then,
Where had he come from, and when,
Lifted from the water, shaken,
Our past forever dead, forsaken,
Then from a dish, rings are taken,
Or finding Nature re-awaken,
Must write true odes, odes gentlemen,
The ladies framed by gentlemen,
This idol for your mind, and pen,
That's it, my friend?' - 'No! Your pen,
Then poetry flows from his pen,
The circle claps to make all happen,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
In love with fame, by freedom bitten,
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
Some army type too will have written,
What odes might Vladimir have written,
Like a hermit in his heaven,
Over-starched and rather brazen,
Another day, and still no sign,
Whom to love, whom to believe in,
Guests squeeze up to let them in,
Hours roll on, and then, again,
Promising, each year, again,
A Lancer, who was loved again,
Then all was altered, and again,
Could they not speak and smile again,
Young and fond, pursue again,
And rose from the bench again,
My darkened mind grew clear again,
Will not be picked apart again,
It is Yevgeny,' sees him plain,
The torments of the soul, the pain,
All the trouble, and the pain,
Another care, profounder pain,
Flattery soon soothed her pain,
Yet virgin hearts, despite its pain,
Who could have seen her silent pain,
My thanks for every sweet refrain,
And then...our hearts we must restrain,
In blissful sleep, it's certain,
Before blood left its scarlet stain,
Was granted to us all in vain,
With icy baths his days begin,
Lensky's here, and with Onegin,
Monsieur L'Abb�, French and thin,
Yet he is yours, through thick and thin,
Rests, on the fantasy within,
More sure than that of friends or kin,
Times from her dear Moscow cousin,
The easier to snare and ruin,
The easier she is to win,
What then? Though his eyes moved on,
She runs, he follows, on and on,
The clock runs swiftly on and on,
Breaks the lilacs, hurrying on,
Their branches, as she stumbles on,
'What is your name?' He moves on,
Fate had granted, Napoleon,
In Moscow, he's near St Simeon,
No sign of the fevered tyrant, Fashion,
Ah, but then the whirl of fashion,
Both had known Fate's passing fashion,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
Was driven, in no uncertain fashion,
Onegin was silent, in his fashion,
Like him she wore the latest fashion,
When far ahead of his battalion,
He toppled from his Kalmuck stallion,
Who is not bored with evasion,
Politely, without indecision,
Lensky, coolly, with precision,
To face society's derision,
Another star had its ascension,
Yevgeny heard with condescension,
Overcome with wit and passion,
Perhaps the ancient flame of passion,
And the waywardness of passion,
But regardless of such passion,
Her distress, her hidden passion,
No one had divined her passion,
Of restless youth's tumultuous passion,
And indignation's icy passion,
Beseech, elicit true confession,
And as it ends, with this confession,
Of her own heartfelt confession,
She likes the orderly progression,
On one and all a strong impression,
He gave heart and soul expression,
What bitter scorn in your expression,
Might have achieved its high mission,
Waited on Moscow's submission,
From the first, he'd spread confusion,
And then? Full of confusion,
Yet within my heart's confusion,
I'm blind to all its illusion,
Modest, tender, sweet illusion,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Every writer's fine creation,
Who reads the works of his creation,
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
Hating all this litigation,
Their errors of pronunciation,
Tears of reconciliation,
Felt inexpressible elation,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
Onegin, in this desolation,
Now, in her cruel isolation,
I know not, yet here's my translation,
There was no end of speculation,
Hosts of rumours in circulation,
But there was no capitulation,
The histories of every nation,
Compassion, and indignation,
To rouse his friend to indignation,
Secure a secret assignation,
Finds a deeper fascination,
Find fresh powers; Imagination,
With profound imagination,
Each figment of imagination,
Love in imagination,
Shapes where her own imagination,
To leave his place of hibernation,
With no apparent consternation,
From dawn, his only occupation,
Fierce jealousy, sad separation,
Nor long years of separation,
How often, dumb with separation,
Nor study, nor loud celebration,
Lacks charm. The new generation,
To yield poetic inspiration,
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
Had fired this heart, pure inspiration,
'Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Long walks, and fresh inspiration,
And you, my youthful inspiration,
To products of my inspiration,
At those sisters' royal decoration,
To the object of his adoration,
Now with greater concentration,
A poor second-hand illustration,
Compelling truth, or illustration,
The chatter, and the conversation,
There of wit, true conversation,
There's a lull in conversation,
Though it adds to conversation,
But merely pleasant conversation,
Of wit, froth, free of affectation,
He wakes to a solicitation,
The fruits of my own meditation,
Such our young dog's meditation,
God be thanked, some imitation,
Which was he? Mere imitation,
Pale, incomplete, an imitation,
And swore in deepening irritation,
In him the poet's exaltation,
At some vile novel's reputation,
Since, to preserve my reputation,
Finding it small deprivation,
The intellect's cold observation,
Forgetting Hymen's gifts, vexation,
Tatyana listened, with vexation,
His presence: kindness is vexation,
Who will fit their speech and action,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
In private judgement on his action,
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
No more of error and distraction,
Nothing can provide distraction,
Had long bored Eugene to distraction,
While, holding him in such affection,
Is it not so? That girl's affection,
He hardly speaks. In his dejection,
Then, intrigued by the collection,
To gaze at will, in her direction,
In your hands, my direction,
Not, blown in every direction,
And though they're filled with contradiction,
Its doomed despite my interdiction,
Blessed, the man who lives a fiction,
Let him but breathe the passing fiction,
But there's a risk in such fiction,
I've scanned the pages of my fiction,
He was loved...such his conviction,
Abandoning all true discretion,
The bitter-sweet lure of ambition,
Ill-rhymed verse, by tradition,
Or to ease the world's condition,
Lensky's estate, worth a mention,
But in parentheses I'll mention,
Or bow to him, make distant mention,
And at long last claim attention,
Another captured her attention,
Charms us with sublime invention,
Till travel, with its tedious motion,
Who taught her this intense emotion,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
He sees, his heart filled with emotion,
She stands, blushing with emotion,
Tatyana with deep emotion,
The house was filled with commotion,
This heartfelt speech, gave the notion,
Each object is, to her notion,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Like women, books proved a deception,
All chained to their pre-conception,
Though I'm an adept at description,
Conveyed a hint, a mere suggestion,
- 'Nurse, now, that's not the question,
Sleep soundly, in oblivion,
A child's slumber, or the moon,
Dreams of a country, lost too soon,
Have that to think, and think, upon,
Plus another hidden reason,
No sentiment to temper reason,
Autumn's gales reveal time's treason,
But in the late and barren season,
'You could afford a winter season,
To his Lovelace, Grandison,
And the peerless Grandison,
Plates, dishes chime, in unison,
Lest tired of pleasure, freedom won,
Stirs the breeze, brings on the morn,
Do we recall those doomed to burn,
For whom her heart was made to burn,
Poor Lensky! In the grave's far bourn,
As much the victim of his fun,
Driven by the springtime sun,
Or in the garden, in the dawn,
Always smiling as the dawn,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
She barely notices the dawn,
Then the shining day will dawn,
She's paler than the moon at dawn,
Past the flowers, down the lawn,
The congregation sit and yawn,
He even felt the urge to yawn,
But all eyes were turned, I own,
Drawn by post-horses, or your own,
At the altar, head bowed down,
Whose kind hand will smooth like down,
And wore, her last defences down,
Vice was ruthlessly put down,
In kerchief and quilted gown,
When the light has barely shown,
Friendship like that's to us unknown,
Soon, beneath the bridal crown,
The woodland path is overgrown,
For the summer, bored with town,
Deep in the country, far from town,
And the servants' quarters! No,
And passed the time as people do,
Never spy on what we do,
Whatever he may say or do,
Onegin, without more ado,
But we must to the garden go,
Now, the mazurka. Long ago,
'Tanya!' - 'You know her?' - 'Long ago,
When you were young, long ago,
From memories of long ago,
Stir, as the murmuring swells; for lo,
Defying then the dread Apollo,
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
Tell of their conquests, others' too,
Flaxen hair, all gleaming, too,
Farwell to my strange hero, too,
Almanacs; and journals, too,
My liberty, though tedious, too,
Ah, friends! How often joyous, too,
Of noble phrases, moral too,
(I love such conversation too,
Loved that cold perfection too,
I liked his face, his manner too,
The coolness of the dark glades too,
Of all, oblivion; this too,
Jokes and carping comments too,
Goes somehow, tomorrow too,
With lines by Baratynsky too,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
The Moscow belles are many too,
Her great delight, she loved them so,
Or in some corner, an hour or so,
That even now can stir us so,
I dare to write about it so,
Sits there as he's accustomed to,
(As their master told them to,
Offers me her own, in quarto,
With guests, may speak a word or two,
To strike a billiard-ball or two,
That there's no infamy so deep,
A book, a walk, sleep that's deep,
Rouse the dull mind from sleep,
Like prisoners released in sleep,
All the world seems lost in sleep,
Be careful of your horses step,
Olga's here with tea to sip,
They'll grumble, swap the latest gossip,
Then down Tverskaya Street they bump,
Stalls flash by, and urchins jump,
Heads, in profile, edges crop,
Lies on the billiard table's top,
Your question ringing in my ear,
A snowdrift shifts, a shaggy bear,
'Farewell, you valleys, peaceful, dear,
I found an honest plain old dear,
But you, the beautiful, and dear,
Sang youthful joy, and childhood dear,
Oh! Those friends, those friends, so dear,
As yet unknown, I held you dear,
Come in, warm yourself, my dear,
It seems to me I'm ill, my dear,
She dare not, in her shame and fear,
That; and perhaps a hidden fear,
Tanya recovers from her fear,
What consoles them is our fear,
But now my friends I often hear,
But Tanya, seeming not to hear,
Over waters still and clear,
Two girls, when the moon shone clear,
My soul heard your voice ring clear,
A frosty night: the sky is clear,
Tatyana's husband looms near,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Those dishes of preserves appear,
The horses scent the dead, and rear,
To raise a smile, provoke a tear,
Olga's less alive by far,
Doctors, they cry: the best by far,
I'll seize a neighbour by the collar,
(Our dear Lomonosov), a grammar,
May yet accustom us to grammar,
The lover too of Rousseau's Julie Womar,
Cottin's Malek-Adhel, de Krudener's de Linar,
Tatyana screams! ...She hears a roar,
Onegin drinks amidst the roar,
The noisy brawl, the banquet's roar,
The thundering breakers' mighty roar,
They bring on the poor child's guitar,
The glittering night holds many a star,
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
When he shows, with the samovar,
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
Her spouse the club's most loyal member,
Now disturbs a young girl's slumber,
We still tremble, being sober,
Not allow that coarse seducer,
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
And you, my dear indulgent reader,
What spirit too! Before we're older,
Her head sinks, the stars grow older,
Eloquence to inspire the bolder,
Her night-dress slips from her shoulder,
Who will refrain from slander,
Lo, the company commander,
This hostile climate where I wander,
Who support us when we wander,
In winter, resting on the fender,
The homage rank may engender,
That pure emotion youth may render,
His youthful love, warm and tender,
To a love both shy and tender,
The room is loud and growing louder,
Into the pans they sift the powder,
So hear me without tears or anger,
Fleeing at the sign of danger,
All her daily walks grow longer,
'Eugene, I was so much younger,
And then Onegin approached her,
Some girl, delighted that he's found her,
Oblivious of the world around her,
She weeps. The books surround her,
A clue the index may afford her,
Prince Vyazemsky sat beside her,
If she might return to see her,
The city's sounds swiftly wake her,
Silent, he bows his head before her,
I married. And now, you must leave her,
His first pipings were of her,
Her dream is deeply worrying her,
He'd make conversation with her,
When, betrothed, she had seen her,
Yet one keen gaze has settled on her,
This deep and learned opus to her,
The men all bowed deeply to her,
Enters softly and disturbs her,
Still no reply, then he finds her,
Here comes Zaretsky, colour higher,
Yet the one whom I set higher,
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
He, as friend in need, you'll gather,
On ramrods, and they grate together,
Whispering solemnly together,
Their arms entwined about each other,
Here without an ounce of bother,
Flee the metropolis, its bother,
Twists her waist one way, another,
Here a village, there another,
He sat down and wrote another,
She was sighing for another,
That somewhere there was another,
To hear the tale told by another,
Each had acted like a brother,
They lift the cold body to its bier,
God's servant and a brigadier,
In this same romance, earlier,
The punctilious German baker,
Some new work of the mask-maker,
Childe Harold, bigot, or Quaker,
Lowered eyes grown clouded, darker,
And there a seasoned traveller,
Melmoth, Maturin's traveller,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
That helped you earn, divine Homer,
And here's Gvozdin, squire and farmer,
Here, with his wife, a portly charmer,
Lacking rosy cheeks, the manner,
Or after a long tedious dinner,
Dimitry Larin, a poor sinner,
She parts then, from the housekeeper,
From the ground floor to the upper,
At last it's over, now it's supper,
He wakes at noon, or even later,
Let me sprinkle you, fetch holy water,
To drive bold tunnels underwater,
She makes him her interpreter,
Hearing in the crowd, and after,
Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
She'd divert me, or her laughter,
Pickled mushrooms for the winter,
A parody of southern winter,
Spoilt by each casual encounter,
But the end to this encounter,
And always, in the final chapter,
Satire's most audacious master,
Not a beauty like her sister,
- Why not? - Well, I'd prefer her sister,
To the hands of fashion's monster,
Or we confuse deeds with chatter,
Their incorrect and careless chatter,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
The young man fled their noisy chatter,
Still add emotion to the matter,
Which to visit first? No matter,
When talk was of some graver matter,
Their solid grasp of every matter,
And looked a poet, to the letter,
Enough. It's time for that letter,
Fare thee well!  and if for ever,
But no! - Down the steps, as ever,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
Alas! Young girls are faithless ever,
The holy secret, lost forever,
That she should hate him now forever,
Enters the salon, with a shiver,
Leaving a shining trail, she'd shiver,
Truly! She didn't even shiver,
Cast-iron spans will leap the river,
And dark beneath the branches' cover,
Fell at a friend's hand! You'll discover,
Who pleased her very soul, a lover,
No more deserving lover,
Reader, alas, that tender lover,
A girl will often change her lover,
Where the nightingale, spring's lover,
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom's lover,
Cattle grazing in the clover,
Shall not attack the lily flower,
At eighteen years he had the power,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh's power,
I count myself free of its power,
Were it within my power,
And I loved you; ah, what answer,
I fear lest this humble prayer,
When morning breezes filled the air,
The gist of some great state affair,
There an old head of scented hair,
A branch leans down to snag her hair,
Sing a song, unbind your hair,
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
Still wept as they unwound my hair,
Places set, each finds a chair,
'By the fireplace, there's his chair,
Rises from his hidden lair,
The price three-fifty for the pair,
But dinner's served, the couples pair,
Lord Byron with a shrewd despair,
Tatyana hears their distant choir,
His neighbour, caused an equal stir,
And as for trouble...well, I'm done for,
'The man's a lunatic, a boor,
She finds a spy-hole in the door,
The sledge is waiting, at the door,
He turns to go, and at the door,
Guests bow politely at the door,
He pushes through the open door,
Follows her from door to door,
Triquet's slumbering on the floor,
The chairs scrape backwards on the floor,
Verse sounds, as he strides the floor,
Or on the ballroom's gleaming floor,
This ruthless critic, legislator,
Yet to my stomach it's a traitor,
The artiste's flatterer and traitor,
Eyes downcast, till her languor,
Where French sounds were de rigeur,
After such unremitting labour,
But they're replete from their labour,
'How is she then, your fair neighbour,
With God knows who for neighbour,
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
In days of dream and ardour,
Telling the story of his ardour,
Sleep and waking have their hour,
Than the insults of this hour,
The bud of life's fairest hour,
Eight years he killed, hour by hour,
My husband's wound, his valour,
His face, the princess, in the parlour,
Of beauties, with the press's clamour,
Is ever-jealous, sullen, sour,
Werther, born to be a martyr,
Of an old uncle, or some father's,
My love for you is as a brother's,
Each man to his own ideas,
Pour out complaints, confessions, pleas,
Beneath his cherries and acacias,
With coaches, carriages and britzkas,
Just like those Van Dyck Madonnas,
Through its pages swiftly combs,
Politely mentioning various topics,
She rushes to the open fields,
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
Where on quiet desert strands,
Yet all too soon the summer ends,
Where in cold blood opposing broods,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
Her Grandison, adept at cards,
Glide smoothly over lacquered boards,
Sleighs and shacks and boulevards,
Fashionable shops, and yards,
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Call to each other in the yards,
All that I knew forgotten. Yes,
Now, no more, of ifs and maybes,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces,
The parlour's full of unknown faces,
Pinched her waist with tight laces,
He notes the boxes, serried places,
An ace of clubs at twenty paces,
Their daughters offer their embraces,
Lap dogs yapping, airs and graces,
They, dear Moscow's living graces,
Possess that cunning, share those vices,
From the first she craved romances,
She reads the sweet romances,
Whatever chapter most entrances,
With what heavenly grace, advances,
Never scorned the world's advances,
Yevgeny, silently advances,
Tired of repeating platitudes,
Before he's drained life to the lees,
Crawling to him on her knees,
To long to fall there, clasp your knees,
A village, a house among the trees,
Ringed by loyal devotees,
The prejudices of the ages,
(Fancies, fables of the ages,
Featherbeds, cockerels in cages,
Skipping over certain pages,
Letters running to six pages,
Who's not exhausted by their rages,
Its feasts forgotten and its speeches,
Here's a hut, to which he dashes,
Now along the track he crashes,
Who never harboured foolish fancies,
As conversation slowly dies,
Not knowing what it signifies,
Sailing the untroubled skies,
But no, beneath Finland's skies,
Under Goethe's, Schiller's skies,
With her carpet, billowing where it lies,
Along the streets where snow-melt lies,
'Here, young Vladimir Lensky lies,
And one bright morning, off he flies,
Scattering herself abroad, she flies,
The door swings open, wide it flies,
'Dear, you can't be well,' replies,
And awkwardness, barely replies,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
And now, recalls past enemies,
Kitchen-gardens, balconies,
Her cheek rests on her hand, she cries,
'Ah, at last!' their hostess cries,
Lamp-posts, mansions, monasteries,
Proud, in its glorious memories,
Pelt him, with ripe red cherries,
And in spring, in hidden vales,
Ancestral portraits stretched for miles,
You were the first, capricious belles,
Not now: we like more polished games,
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Where is the storm of love's extremes,
For whom, to expiate our crimes,
While the girls recite old rhymes,
We wrote all those secret rhymes,
Meet the sky in sombre lines,
Come away, my pretty ones,
While we, of Hymen's charms the foes,
The shepherd, weaving his bast shoes,
Behind the strange bed's silken drapes,
Triquet, ingenious poet, dares,
Of all the authors she admires,
Sweet conversation that inspires,
You'll learn its bliss, its desires,
I've found all that a poet desires,
Would join the literary bores,
Our poor Tatyana recognises,
There the Petrovsky palace rises,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Frost already, frozen noses,
Like the sins that youth rehearses,
Some wild past your heart rehearses,
In a red peruke and glasses,
The hearth glows, pipe-smoke passes,
(With Panil Kharlikov, who passes,
Then Onegin swiftly dresses,
Proud beauties' in their flimsy dresses,
Orders Guillot, since time presses,
The balcony, whose throng oppresses,
How? From that wilderness...' He uses,
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
The merry lads cut with their skates,
Receive my thanks, and grateful dues,
Abandoned for barbaric tongues,
Spring clothes the branches with new leaves,
Not all will see what your soul weaves,
Despite the pallor languor gives,
To his stand the cabman drives,
Pustyakov the plump arrives,
While the babble of their wives,
Of our prophetic meeting: yes,
At the gate, says her goodbyes,
Of raucous laughter swell; all eyes,
Forbidden fruit before our eyes,
The human harvest to our eyes,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
The tears flow from my eyes,
Again imagination blazes,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
Of wisdom, then for coffee rings,
Like Byron, who of Gulnare sings,
Tanya's birthday, filled with greetings,
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
They're harnessed to the master's sleighs,
'I am in love' Tatyana sighs,
Far now from praise, he sighs,
Under the oak-trees' sheltering boughs,
Were ever dearest friends of his,
In a time far, far from this,
What in the world is worse than this,
Petushkov, neighbourhood Adonis,
But through some process of osmosis,
Magnetism or hypnosis,
- The duellists remove their cloaks,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
The frost glitters. We give thanks,
For a swift interchange of looks,
Comparing notes, like circling sharks,
Fashionable Record Office clerks,
Folksongs, and the wedding chorals,
That there existed chosen vessels,
To her village, despite its hovels,
Her garden, her romantic novels,
Where the swan in beauty sails,
To mend Europe's dainty coils,
Meanwhile the village Cyclops toils,
And in his silent room recalls,
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
A flow of silhouetted stills,
Twice a year, loved Christmas carols,
With friendship's and wisdom's pearls,
Such albums of provincial girls,
And a host of younger girls,
Could you conceive those golden curls,
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
On the girl's pale beauty gleams,
In the silvery moonlight, dreams,
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
And you, the bright celestial dreams,
Oh, be spared these fearful dreams,
You appeared to me in dreams,
Meanwhile, the sad moon dreams,
What laughter from enchanted streams,
The ice that paves the hidden streams,
With some dangerous volume roams,
Not even plain idiocy redeems,
Stirred by a stranger's glance, it seems,
Relations then are those, it seems,
Because her simplicity, it seems,
Welcome her with open arms,
With exclamations at her charms,
Chairs, chests, and watering-cans,
Of wild geese, in noisy clans,
Jars of jam, and frying-pans,
Come you maidens, pretty maidens,
Propped on her elbow, now she pens,
Among them all, confusion reigns,
Tatyana the pale garden gains,
Over it he'd rack his brains,
The glittering stars, their endless trains,
Driven by its laws and fashions,
Those high aims ambition fashions,
But most of all they talked of passions,
Where now are the burning passions,
Full of life's sincerest passions,
Yevgeny took, in dreamy sessions,
Alone amongst his new possessions,
Are subject to infatuations,
Hearing the same outworn objections,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Then he turns away - and yawns,
For Eugene, falls from her lips,
To kiss the young Armida's lips,
A foreign tongue it is that slips,
Past the bridge, and pond, she stops,
But still the pounding in her ears,
He with lawyers round his ears,
Threats, entreaties, vows and fears,
The two friends' greeting scarcely hears,
Then as the rural evening nears,
Early, the will to rule appears,
He waits then Lensky appears,
Hysteria, fainting, tragic tears,
Deceit, and slander, rings and tears,
I'm grieving still, but free of tears,
Her eyes are clouded, filled with tears,
Then you would weep, yet your tears,
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
At the turning of the years,
For social worlds beyond her years,
Our troikas fit to run for years,
Lions on gates, with frozen roars,
My pen I find no longer wanders,
Her soul in distant regions wanders,
So lively are our charioteers,
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
Or with a burning hand touch hers,
You fortunate philosophers,
It's time, you inveterate idlers,
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
To torment fashionable rhymesters,
The wary traveller first shivers,
Settee and table, chests of drawers,
Malicious cowards, slanderous players,
Printed among the ancient airs,
And Flyanov, toss and turn on chairs,
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
On her shoulders, adjust the furs,
In this countryside of ours,
Now he rested from his labours,
No fields prove to be her neighbours,
And was wept for by his neighbours,
Of clock or watch I count the hours,
I've wasted far too many hours,
Drawn to the tree, and what sours,
That heartless icy look of yours,
When through the thanksgiving Mass,
No connoisseur with opera glass,
Nothing from that darkened glass,
The twilit view beyond the glass,
In the water's smooth still glass,
My disenchanted opera-glass,
There they sit, the minutes pass,
And a house - where shadows pass,
So youth's happiness must pass,
Cast-iron statue which they pass,
To see, unwillingly, as they pass,
Like fresh air they loved their kvass,
But the cold, aloof Princess,
She seems the image, to excess,
It's peppered with them to excess,
The unapproachable goddess,
No Russian terms exist, confess,
Strength to complain, I confess,
Time's done it's work, I must confess,
He scrapped the old corv�e, no less,
To persuade my parents, no less,
There lives, and thrives no less,
At home all day, more or less,
Old, Tanya, and my mind...God bless,
Even their slanders meaningless,
All is so pale and colourless,
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Yields to pensive idleness,
Curses their hours of idleness,
Epigram in all its coarseness,
As it is, I ask forgiveness,
It's all too much such happiness,
With such ephemeral happiness,
'I was not born for happiness,
And portrayed love's happiness,
No breath at all of haughtiness,
On a rich pie (its saltiness,
The sun now dispels the darkness,
No absurdity, no foulness,
It's time to leave. Feigning calmness,
A prophet in the wilderness,
In the intellectual wilderness,
Who inspired such tenderness,
She loves in all seriousness,
At the same hour's sweet caress,
And as for our young votaress,
The girls in fashionable dress,
The princess, in a simple dress,
The gleam of wit and silken dress,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Peacefully their lives progress,
Falls silent. Only heir, heiress,
All those torments that oppress,
He'd dare to toy with a tress,
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Turn pale, or blush with distress,
In noting Tanya's distress,
Champagne is like a mistress,
A lady approaches the hostess,
Where is he, now?' 'You'll never guess,
On the table, bubble, hiss,
And calms his fears with a kiss,
Mourning her husband's absent kiss,
With warmth a comrade's manly kiss,
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
Uttered in those days of bliss,
Beneath the table's damask gloss,
In the springtime on the moss,
He trots, performs amazing feats,
Military dandies, diplomats,
Past the ranked aristocrats,
Went to pay his fond respects,
Her work the crackling firewood lights,
And to those seductive nights,
Is this the destiny that waits,
Cossacks, Bokharans, merchants,
Pharmacies, towers, and peasants,
By a pillar, between two aunts,
By critics of the higher arts,
Grateful, in my heart of hearts,
Of follies fit to test the courts,
Arrive to laughter, schoolboy jests,
Sometimes they receive as guests,
Hopes she'll warm, if he insists,
But he is stubborn and persists,
Into verse that would amaze us,
To roam the forests green, so us,
And all their echoes false to us,
When we see him, when he's near us,
Follow the bland crowd that bores us,
- 'You're right, and so you'd show us,
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Like Horace, peaceful and sagacious,
Once scorned by the malicious,
Sparkling, lively, and capricious,
As affected, strange and vicious,
Since that old duellist is vicious,
Their laughter noisy, tedious,
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Asks Larina, curious,
He thought them quite innocuous,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
Nor foreign beauties, foreign views,
And listen to the forest news,
Golden cornfields, flowery meadows,
As verse inside him burns and glows,
She plunges on, he grunts and follows,
Misty climes, and vague tomorrows,
He sang of parting and of sorrows,
They exchanged their childish vows,
Shorter and shorter grow the days,
'Tanya! What a notion! In those days,
In those old Lyceum days,
Ceased to count the summer days,
Sleeps soundly, passes thus his days,
And where he spent those icy days,
The delights of frosty days,
The tedious halts that, with delays,
A casual guest comes, sits and plays,
On a steep slope, in the sun's rays,
Sad rustling fills the woodland ways,
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
In happiness, in idle ways,
And my mother-in-law, bless her ways,
He gently yielded to its ways,
As for me....they're not my ways,
He sought the forest's shadowy ways,
The load on each kibitka sways,
Blinded, dazed by sombre joys,
You'll drink the poison love employs,
Bottles of Cliquot or Mo�t,
A pulse, the blood's living heat,
That a friend would not repeat,
Of that last cutlet's fiery fat,
An instant hails the entrechat,
A dwarf who sports a tail; and that,
Warning her of this and that,
A bit of this a bit of that,
And we can all display �clat,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
Custom demands. They sat and sat,
With that secret, gave her dictat,
And there you'll see, without a doubt,
Exhaust him, now, let him doubt,
And prettier then, too, no doubt,
Now estimates we need, in fact,
So blameless in their intellect,
So clever, and so circumspect,
Sketching women's legs and feet,
Threads the rows among the feet,
The groves and meadows at her feet,
In pain and sorrow, at your feet,
Touching the earth with her light feet,
Of candlelight, the dancers fleet,
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
Don't be cross with me, my sweet,
Youth slipped by, years to forget,
You bear no blame. I can't forget,
There in the garden, where we met,
There's Princess Helena's tulle bonnet,
In chilled bottles, for the poet,
Like Byron, pride's perfect poet,
Is it not true, my fellow poet,
On the granite parapet,
Their loss, without pain or regret,
For careless youth's without regret,
Display their vests, or form a set,
To his rivals, that whole set,
Tatyana feels half-dead; Triquet,
The Tambov wit, Monsieur Triquet,
And life's horizons broad as yet,
To bear the marriage-yoke as yet,
Lecturing me, so fiercely...yet,
Eugene, now Vladimir had left,
For his estate, where she, bereft,
Doubt is over, they will fight,
Incite two friends of his to fight,
The desk with its shaded light,
A wintry carpet deep and light,
And I - perhaps, far from the light,
Rising with the morning light,
A duel in the morning light,
And the moon's celestial light,
'Ah, but the elegy's so light,
He read, by an inner light,
In coaches, burdensome or light,
Gazing on the moon, its light,
With that pale diaphanous light,
Beside the mill, and at first light,
If I were certain at first light,
Soon the dawn will bring new light,
His mare snorts at the snowy light,
The Muse set my world alight,
He was her solace and delight,
His labour, torment and delight,
Were what gave her most delight,
Crossed her path, in panicked flight,
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
She'd lead me in the dead of night,
She'd dream of him at dead of night,
Solitude, silence, dark of night,
How often, on a summer's night,
Till January the third, at night,
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
A simple Russian scene, by night,
Never placed him in the right,
Where are you, now? It's your right,
In as brief a cartel as was right,
The dawn is breaking, crimson, bright,
Her sad eyes tearful and bright,
To bring, with love and solace bright,
'The morning star will tremble bright,
'Whoever's love for you's more bright,
His springtime occupation bright,
The moon no longer shines as bright,
Silently: the dawn was bright,
Silvering loosened hair, tears bright,
To hear the Nereids' whispers bright,
In her confusion she'd take fright,
No time to retrieve it, in her fright,
The wild host vanishes from sight,
Between the lines that met his sight,
Friend or foe, it matters naught,
Good and evil, what science taught,
We've toppled Lovelace as we ought,
Ardent and eccentric thought,
Young poet of meditative thought,
Sparked a deeper train of thought,
Whatever the future might have brought,
And the shame dishonour brought,
Farewell. Whatever it was you sought,
Such am I. Was it this you sought,
So unlooked-for, I'll not give it,
Lack the strength just now to live it,
And never breathe a word of it,
By the entrance step, or on it,
Who'll solemnly consider it,
'I'll not keep you, but where is it,
Even though he cannot know it,
Those dear creatures, oh, you know it,
Its violent storms, are blessed by it,
That I have here daubed my portrait,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
In your thoughts, you would wait,
A tedious season we await,
But none of them have changed a bit,
Hates the tedium of their visit,
'I hate the fashionable circuit,
I know I'm slow, and short of wit,
Upon it, sadly, Tanya leant,
Alas, now some are distant,
Not looking backward for an instant,
Hastily he rings; the servant,
He gave his arm: downcast, head bent,
At heart a simple innocent,
To all this; yet, an innocent,
Not even a joke half-innocent,
Or tortured vanity, dark, quiescent,
Marriageable girls there, in a crescent,
Not even just by accident,
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
To whom hope her brightness lent,
Where, above shadowy waters blent,
Abandoned, the fields are silent,
At first I wished to stay quite silent,
Who mingled with some pure lament,
Some subtle whispered compliment,
That's no ready compliment,
To see what fresh enlightenment,
From porch to yard, in a moment,
And now, at this very moment,
Lensky, blazing with resentment,
Yet built an eternal monument,
And substituted light quit-rent,
Trembling too, with her intent,
About the volume's true content,
Habit brought her quiet content,
But of those, good friends, insistent,
Then sips the news from some vile font,
He swims that little Hellespont,
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
Adorns the table, boiling hot,
Lived you to the full, in riot,
Cosmopolitan, patriot,
My country: exile was my lot,
A vital force flows from the root,
The future by some magic art,
He'd scorned, for her lack of art,
Unripe powers, or fading art,
His glance now bold, with tender art,
But scarcely comprehends their art,
God knows whom and what; your art,
Or because her love lacks art,
Some fragment of my precious art,
My poor Lensky, from the heart,
Tries to calm her beating heart,
The deepest secret of her heart,
A thought took root in her heart,
My verse may touch someone's heart,
Pressing his hand to his heart,
Pale afternoon is here, my heart,
Your grief, would never move my heart,
Towards me, wake hope in my heart,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Wailing aloud her tragic part,
Then so be it: in friendship part,
Behind the mill, while there, apart,
Some he liked and placed apart,
Instead of bristling from the start,
Not pain, but death. So, at the start,
She gazes - feels a throbbing start,
Live in that name, what echoes start,
His sharp claws, she lies inert,
Manzoni, Herder, and Chamfort,
By some careless lad for sport,
That serious and heartless sport,
Make a blunt or sharp retort,
Besides' - he thought - 'the die is cast,
An awkward guest at such a feast,
The noise, the tempests, and the feast,
And to the revels and the feast,
Blessed is he, who leaves the feast,
For all your gifts, even the least,
Not one to savour it in the least,
Virginal hope within her breast,
Fresh dreams will replace the last,
Onegin's tongue-tied to the last,
I travel another road, at last,
Found another, served at last,
And my Eugene was free at last,
As, after winter's icy blast,
To separate blancmange from roast,
Two hours at least, but then, once past,
This fever born of youth once past,
In the high style of the past,
Recalling romance of time past,
Traditions of the ages past,
Sang Russia's glorious ages past,
The guests have come, the hour is past,
Health, life's beauty, sweetness past,
Our brightest hopes, and the best,
A walk indeed would suit me best,
A glimpse of life, or a jest,
By slight of hand, or by some jest,
Sed alia tempora! With the rest,
Parading there with all the rest,
Our dreams, those dearer than the rest,
Did full justice to the rest,
His sad heart prevents all rest,
Then, till Morpheus brought her rest,
All glad at heart to take their rest,
Or perhaps a pleasant rest,
Then rooms are found for every guest,
Voice, manner, slender waist,
And glasses, tall, with narrow waist,
Changed places: there, you have the gist,
So, for an evening game of whist,
Or, as if they'd ceased to exist,
Eugene more tolerant than most,
To suffer passion's parching thirst,
As his horses plough the dust,
Who keep my pyramid from rust,
Of history all turned to rust,
Virgil, Byron, Walter Scott,
Inns, there are none. In some hut,
'Mine', Yevgeny's voice rings out,
With many a solemn vow round about,
For you, still drag myself about,
He laughs - and they all fall about,
Prone to lead a fool about,
At forty suffer from the gout,
Of horn and hoof and crooked snout,
Eat, drink, yawn; ill, and stout,
Browsed through Gibbon and Rousseau,
I've bowed to classicism: you,
While such dreams pursue you,
I freeze - my God! - to think of you,
Pay attention now I beg you,
By afternoon, of seeing you,
Olga and her mother ask you,
Though seeing the tenderness in you,
Though he is unknown to you,
Indifferent to me or you,
Snore for snore, fat Pustyakov,
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,
And the ex-councillor Flyanov,
Then my 'cousin', Buyanov,
Fang and tusk and blood-stained jaw,
He offers her a long curved claw,
Beard, tufted tail, sharp gleaming claw,
The Corsair or the Wandering Jew,
A lily in the morning dew,
Of what the fashionable view,
At that time, and retired from view,
And hides it suddenly from view,
I suddenly beheld that view,
Time dragged slowly or it flew,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
How skilfully he'd feign the new,
For two days it was all quite new,
As meek, as deaf, who, nothing new,
Where I'm told I'm nothing new,
Passion's tempests will renew,
The hours of anguished prayer I knew,
To each other, but liking grew,
Noise, laughter, curtsey, bow,
And ask your Muse to take a bow,
Through this wide world. We bow,
Silent, leaning on an elbow,
The solitariness of the meadow,
On the misted glass, a shadow,
Tatyana hovers at the window,
His housekeeper, gazed out the window,
'The one who sat by the window,
While others sneered at the show,
Her voice tender, sweet and low,
And all the world lies still, below,
Heels pounding on the wood below,
Over the simple urn below,
He sees a youth there, far below,
All serious effort - no words flow,
One window yields a rosy glow,
From the whispering tongues, allow,
Moved our hero, I'll allow,
As soon as daybreak will allow,
'Peasants there in riches wallow,
A mirror underneath the pillow,
Albion's proud lyre I follow,
From the avenging bullet; now,
Only the shepherd, aged now,
Unnoticed, Tanya seated now,
Baratynsky, were you with me now,
No gift, no feast she gave him now,
Your poor Tanya, even now,
All this is out of fashion now,
Latin's not in fashion now,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
And yet, I am another's now,
Onegin's love for books, we know,
What's to be done? As we all know,
The rage and spite she cannot know,
To our neighbour... he, you know,
Enough, it's all the same, you know,
As for Lensky's fate, you know,
Not? Besides I'd have you know,
Asleep it seems on melting snow,
Trees crowd round; it's drowned in snow,
The gleaming radiance on snow,
And that inscription on their brow,
Where two shadowy pine trees grow,
Past the doorman like an arrow,
Ready to serve, today, tomorrow,
Looked for a divorce tomorrow,
I've learnt the sadness of tomorrow,
Forced to forgo that sweet tomorrow,
In misfortune, and in sorrow,
Wept violently in her sorrow,
Another's joy, another's sorrow,
Friends, for the poet now you sorrow,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
To keep well clear of them, I vow,
God sent you to me, I avow,
Without an aim on which to fix,
Reaching the age of twenty-six,
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
And creditors had him at bay,
Alas! Her friend of many a day,
That occupied each night and day,
She loved to greet the break of day,
That sitting by the bed all day,
But never a fresh thought all day,
From Romulus to our own day,
Looks out, noting it is day,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
All went smoothly from that day,
Longing to journey, day by day,
They rode together every day,
He'd sit here of a Sunday,
'He promised he'd come, today,
Of levied serfs, bathed Saturday,
To join them, it's next Saturday,
'Let's go.' They leave without delay,
Martin Zedeka can't allay,
To delight in childish play,
Olga's little friends to play,
Where on blue ice-floes light-beams play,
Lights the mind with its bright ray,
He enters...ah, what news, hurray,
Bringing breakfast on a tray,
Her nightmare seeming to portray,
Like autumn leaves, that fall and stray,
Monotonous and varied, say,
At tag in the meadows, say,
Even now I hear him say,
Though why it is, who can say,
(The Romantic style, or so they say,
Not needing to prolong his stay,
With your staff point out the way,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Thrilled him in its former way,
The band will come: they're on their way,
Would Hymen strew along our way,
Our friend behaved well, in his way,
Now anxious to be on his way,
Let her pursue her own sweet way,
Homeward they go the shortest way,
And we....don't shine in any way,
And stride in arches every way,
The sledded coaches, stored away,
Then his father passed away,
As the stars' choir fades away,
His beaver-collar shines away,
Russia will be one great highway,
Happy the one who has passed by,
And, if permitted, by and by,
Then supper, bedtime, by and by,
To all unfaithful by and by,
(As was the case in times gone by,
The light-footed girls sweep by,
Of its arrow, or death wings by,
A brief snow-flurry spirals by,
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
More deeply in his lunacy,
Penned with unerring accuracy,
Liked his dreamy tendency,
They've taken four steps already,
'Now, approach!' Calm and steady,
And choke him with a tragedy,
Produced his hive of comedy,
A stoneware jug of cider handy,
In another home-made brandy,
But now our minds are somewhat cloudy,
Even in books, virtue's dowdy,
Through meadows, down a lime-tree alley,
Deep in the hill-encircled valley,
The Skotinins, turning grey,
Or worse still, freeze and petrify,
I love youth's frantic energy,
Turned, and saw before her: 'Why,
At least a pretence of empathy,
And when a meteor crossed the sky,
The moon, a lamp in the sky,
A brilliant azure lights the sky,
Roam beneath my African sky,
Leaning on the dam-wall, Lensky,
Toasting his fair neighbour, Lensky,
'And here with our neighbour, Lensky,
Glancing round to seek her Lensky,
Eugene stares down at Lensky,
While, quite the engineer, Zaretsky,
Let us part now amicably,
Treading the boards interminably,
At home receives him equably,
But who, in this select assembly,
But Tanya wrote it all so badly,
Richardson she loved quite madly,
Never read Russian papers, sadly,
Read it secretively, sadly,
So the gullible would blindly,
While Zaretsky measures nicely,
Should be forgot...so, opportunely,
His expression quite sincerely,
And promise you, most sincerely,
- 'But why berate him so severely,
Guard your daughters most severely,
Tea, then: the girls take up, demurely,
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Next they sit, and talk politely,
Leaning, musing pensively,
Stated it quite positively,
Olga's turned into, so lovely,
The greater her attempts to fly,
As giddy youth, the dancers fly,
All is well: our moments fly,
From the yard the serf-boys fly,
Cock their pistols, and let fly,
Reaches the table, speedily,
Who'll be there? Just the family,
'So I joined another family,
Delayed though, temporarily,
Poor Guillot stands, uneasily,
Eugene stood there uneasily,
Arrive, and greeted heartily,
Where days flowed by so lazily,
His eyes from you...there now, quickly,
All things declare, and magically,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Greet her enthusiastically,
In London sets especially,
To be condemned impartially,
Who's dropped by accidentally,
The storm is done, and cruelly,
Their visits an unwelcome folly,
He slept at last, but fitfully,
Takes aim now - when, suddenly,
He might have spoken openly,
As he lowers horns, stubbornly,
Singer of Feasts and melancholy,
Lost in her deep melancholy,
Her pallor, and her melancholy,
'Killed!'...And with that stark reply,
The day slips past, with no reply,
Deaf, voiceless, never to reply,
With staple products its supply,
Yet her spouse loved her dearly,
Is it because we're given, clearly,
Trusted her himself, quite clearly,
She disregards him utterly,
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Zaretsky bites his lip, crossly,
All objects spoke mysteriously,
Against intruders; furiously,
Foot it sweetly, now and neatly,
His dreams disturb him sadly, sweetly,
When in the doorway, loudly, sweetly,
The night's shadows thinning swiftly,
Refused - found consolation swiftly,
Perhaps I turned away too swiftly,
Though precious time goes swiftly,
Nature wakes from dream, lightly,
Yet, inclined to treat them lightly,
And the edge of earth grows brightly,
Still clutching his pistol, tightly,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
It brought to life, instantly,
You appeared, and instantly,
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
Then gaze at Tanya, silently,
Reading a letter, silently,
Hoarding her treasure silently,
Is he, who lingers silently,
Enters the study silently,
Blows and howls - and presently,
Love's madness, wild and unruly,
Then, across the fields, slowly,
By both friend and enemy,
To infuriate your enemy,
The smart coquettes' smart enemy,
As a recluse, idle, gloomy,
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
But as for genius, if any,
And when I fled that company,
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
Of life itself and destiny,
Where, held in the hands of destiny,
With what strange languid agony,
No villain's hidden agony,
Habit soothed her agony,
Her heart still, in it's agony,
When I was but a little boy,
In foreign gig that you employ,
'Ah, Nurse, Nurse, I'm so unhappy,
Beyond the voiceless boundary,
My incorrigible, never weary,
A fashionable glossary,
In dreams, that fevered, solitary,
That dressing room, all solitary,
Await the touch, involuntary,
More pleasant still, if he should cry,
'Clear the road!' loud sings the cry,
But swiftly, at her nervous cry,
Listen for the heart's first cry,
Let it not wither, harsh and dry,
The wafer meant to seal it's dry,
Waves her mantle, somewhat tawdry,
That sad and dangerous mystery,
No rhetoric, no flattery,
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Proud witness of that fallen glory,
A Petersburg ball, in all its glory,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
Her face possessed his memory,
Tanya, it's gone, my memory,
Drive on! And, to resume our story,
A cure for my sad history,
To give his life for poetry,
Betrays no trace of coquetry,
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
Before, to prompt her minstrelsy,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Then calmly stir his jealousy,
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
St Petersburg's high society,
Once more rejects society,
Exhausted by society,
Would give you notoriety,
Ingenuous naivety,
And far away from our great city,
Wishes, good health, felicity,
Faced with her sweet simplicity,
His unique eccentricity,
A melancholy oddity,
Then prove his own mortality,
Moments of grave sublimity,
My world with equanimity,
Hope and love and enmity,
Perhaps this is all vanity,
Her smile, her calm serenity,
A few steps from eternity,
The Muse gave it eternity,
A satanic monstrosity,
And in deep perplexity,
Awakes a young man's loyalty,
Now, I'm in some difficulty,
Him hope, deploy uncertainty,
So thin, and sparse, and so empty,
His fervent dreams of liberty,
Distanced from the claims of beauty,
Written by my pure young beauty,
I gave my word, and it's my duty,
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
His gaze inspired: how he could preach! -
From a novel, yet here you are...!' -
I'll introduce you. Upon my life!' -
'But oh, the expense, not like here!' -
May the Good Lord preserve us still!' -
What do you say?' - 'Alright!' - 'Bravo!' -
- 'Nurse, how slow you are to guess!' -
And he must never mention me...' -
'And this is my own Tatyana.' -
The setting for a pretty face.' -
'Yes, but who is she? - 'That's my wife.' -
- 'Oh, Nurse, you won't refuse me.' -
Go now, take this note of mine.' -
But no! Not a bit of it, he's gone.' -
'Look to the left, now, there's a thing.' -
How long?' - 'Oh, two years or so.' -
There's no reason for you not to.' -
You must go, no matter what.' -
No suspicions... nurse, obey.' -
Better than one dour modern lyric?' -
'To the left? Where? What's to see?' -
That moment - how should we forget? -
Finding all jealousy absurd -
'Ah, Tanya, dear! Come, let me see -
Felitsa's virtues set to rhyme -
And beside her, her Eugene -
All that is glad, lives, never mine -
For but a moment, mind and sense -
For idleness and sense to waste -
To dispute the entrance to the grave -
Of honour: ready - it was his goal -
And all you ladies sentimental -
Might have been turned to better ends -
Here's an end to all their jokes -
The one she fears and idolises -
'Surely it's not' - Yevgeny muses -
And I -with a sigh, I confess -
In whatever way words can entreat -
Bring fresh beauty to the view -
Bank and brake, sweet waters flow -
And kept dull boredom far away -
Almost embraced pure poetry -
And dined with her d�shabill�.
His rustic answer: 'Agafon'.
Though it's perfect for an epigram...).
(A predilection we should praise).
In it: no matter, that's by the way).
Of beaus and Circes speak her fate! ...
Faced with her soul's bright clarity! ...
The world to him both sealed and dumb? ...
Your tears, verse, et cetera, when? ...
'Should I turn back now, or go on? ...
Part in kindness, giving quarter? ...
And so she wrote in French of course ...
What languor's in her magic glances!...
Sighing: 'It's high time she was wed!'...
I cede my own in deference.....
My soul, nothing can renew....
Then to the altar, by and by....
Mine another destiny....
No affected coquetry....
Must take this letter, secretly, to O...
Seemed as one to poor Tatyana...
Second stroll, and then et cetera...
To whom the first few lines were read...
The letter's done, is folded, sealed...
A roaring in her ears, eyes dazed...
Our face will never cross their mind...
Lensky's luckless sacrifice...
A victim, decked out for the gale...
- 'Don't think...truly...don't accuse me...
Considers vulgar. (Pardon me...
Cousin, it's like a dream to me...
Of boredom to her spouse, was gone...
That was ordained by fate, alone...
Move in their harmonious sphere...
Meadows silver, sunlight meagre...
My thanks. I took my joy, and more...
Such stuff as Lafontaine's suppose...
Our secret balm, a tear, a sigh...
Where they fall, others flourish...
The steward came; he'd read a book...
'Never you mind that, just look...
For my Tatyana, long forsaken...
I beseech your protection...
A Lancer, with undying devotion...
O magic night, enchanted moon...
Opinions they express in town...
Left her uncertain what to do...
Wilful, wild, but empty too...
Pushes the door till it's ajar...
All that Onegin knew about her...
Both his father and his mother...
Oh Lord! What can I get you, daughter...
My heart sinks now, in shame and terror...
- 'Just a little more, a flavour...
For a noisy world of vanities...
Scream rings out...the cabin shakes...
Strange broken music of the steppes...
Seeing its sad face tremble, pass...
But gaze at him, as she surveys...
Not she? It is though...no...and yet...
'But now, too late: the moment's past...
Oh, I've no strength...it's my chest...
We both should take a little rest...
Till in the grave we shall rest...
Sinks to rest...
Then settle like the evening mist...
I'm not known; he's not about...
Eyes misted, as they sped away...
And then, to part us utterly...

The children learn their ABC.
The sacred letters, O and E.
Thou, my Svetlana.
So, she is called Tatyana.
They say in turn's the nearest spa.
Of our proud imperial Neva.
Pushes its grandsires to the tomb.
In my thoughts, I was struck dumb.
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
Where to? God knows. The trail is dead.
Such things belong to youth, now dead.
His wedding two scant weeks ahead.
The winged god hovers overhead.
Which Olga never would have read.
- 'At the Larins.' - 'How very odd.
Drives home, preferring his own bed.
In confusion, thoughts perturbed.
All the neighbours were seduced.
The brief acquaintances were ended.
That here was wit and charm indeed.
Fashionable rings they need.
That's sired by boredom out of greed.
And yet my Onegin's etched.
His nag: it's ill, it nearly died.
Has never with letters been allied.
And cloistered life Onegin led.
The huntsman by the hedge, concealed.
The lady of the manse has fled.
To an unknown world's enthralled.
Words echoing there: Well and Killed.
In working something she'd designed.
Her nod as quiet and restrained.
Alone, to Lensky's taste inclined.
Nor went mad, or died, as feared.
The winter snows soon disappeared.
Where my heart has long been smothered.
To ease the pain his love incurred.
Curbs the flames with which I'm cursed.
By winter her mute heart's oppressed.
With quicker wits, might have guessed.
Their love, their hatred, went un-missed.
Buyanov's asked her: she refused.
Surveyed it, and pontificated.
At dinner, when intoxicated.
For conversation's art created.
Then a buzz, while all are seated.
Are raised again, the work's completed.
You must go, they'd be delighted.
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
With all their weary weight allotted.
The simple girlish way she loved.
Due rank and custom they observed.
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Unhappy with the role he'd played.
He watched her as she sang and played.
Where the pensive dryads played.
It's been willingly displayed.
Over the girl, and trembling prayed.
A meaning that her heart obeyed.
By nervous hands, mind half-obeyed.
Fine verses on his Finnish Maid.
Nature's debt already paid.
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
As stern, as distant, and as frigid.
Though silent on the bad he hid.
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
Yet his life grew sad and cold.
No need to keep reserves of gold.
Opposite his friend must stand.
To know its beauty, be its friend.
Am I unworthy, you would find.
Leaving not a trace behind.
And your reproach repay in kind.
Enchantment, with an unspoiled mind.
Chest puffed out, content in mind.
Your true seducer in your mind.
Not such as to engage his mind.
Of every guest there, in his mind.
A General's, noble, to my mind.
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
By our heroine sits, spell-bound.
Tatyana lingers: she's spell-bound.
Funds for a Moscow winter found.
His weapon spirals to the ground.
Advice both sensible and sound.
With the glasses' clinking sound.
Though sad echoes still resound.
From the start, had fired his blood.
Flute, bassoon, are gladly heard.
Of shame or misery, one word.
Here is his letter, word for word.
A dark reproach in every word.
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
All that we now find absurd.
He'd agreed, what found absurd.
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
The dawning day in sombre cloud.
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
As much as in Moscow, the proud.
My songs inspired by that crowd.
This fortune-telling, I'll let be.
A sensitive and handsome face.
Noting the pallor in her face.
Then rattle on at lightening pace.
Listen now to my sad voice.
Mazurka, gallop, waltz...they dance.
Before you, let him now advance.
That breathes a young girl's innocence.
Stables, kitchens, and a fence.
Though innocent tries one's patience.
Among sad cliffs for preference.
'Well?' says Zaretsky, with force.
Where he his visitation made.
The tribute that to folly's made.
To enter on the masquerade.
Her secret wish to it confide.
Some girlish secret that they hide.
Then gather momentum in its slide.
The Muse was ever at my side.
Into society he rode.
On my troubled mind intrude.
She'd sit all day in solitude.
To tell iambic from trochee.
By fate's implacable decree.
He's a menace in the first degree.
With all the taste we used to see.
Nothing to occupy his life.
And tiresome pleasures full of strife.
Like a shadow, or a wife.
Their dinner-table and their wife.
At the campaign, the snow, his wife.
By his children and his wife.
You alone would be my wife.
Reader of dreams to the age.
Or gratitude from age to age.
Old monkeys of another age.
His taste was of a former age.
Her face, like one about to die.
Frost's silver powders on it lie.
R�veillez-vous, belle endormie.
He followed still, for customs sake.
Deceived - a welcome rest would take.
A shepherd's pipe wakes the dale.
In night's deep silence, tells its tale.
To keep from the gambling table.
Is carved in stone, immutable.
Force you to lie awake, and mumble.
Shine, conquer, and retreat, still single.
His epigrams topped up with bile.
Nasce una gente a cui l'morir none dole.
Careless of fame, the brittle.
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
Then listen now, in secret, with me.
One I adored, but now it bores me.
No matter: a just fate awaits me.
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
Rooted to the ground, in shame.
More than usual?' 'No, the same.
Since, I'm one too and just the same.
Though we decried them, at the time.
That stands impervious to time.
Tells him, now is dinner-time.
With all its mysteries of home.
It's as monotonous as home.
As they fly like arrows towards home.
Borne away to change at home.
Age drives away the urchin, rhyme.
It sparkles, like the Hippocrene.
 - 'Nurse, it's nothing, I feel fine.
Only what anger may define.
Names like Akulka, not C�line.
To my Tatyana, all is one.
He ends the struggle and has done.
'Nothing,' he answers, and is gone.
Until her strength is all but gone.
To any but ourselves alone.
Forgo the city's ceaseless drone.
And sings, and plaits a lime-bark shoe.
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are.
With vulgar tales is coarse and bare.
He noticed nothing, did not care.
A love that's innocent, sincere.
Not without cause I hail them here.
Beneath this stone, rests quietly here.
His mind a whirl, he wandered there.
There's very little pleasure there.
And spirit finds creative fire.
To tempt her with his base desire.
Sleep deserted her entire.
Kind and tender than before.
Or the granite of the shore.
The like of them, one or more.
Far from Italy's allure.
And never fully plumb its measure.
Dear liberty and leisure.
Ones whose Mamas plot his capture.
And not forget the pistol-case.
Did all that was required to please.
Else paradise is no paradise.
Seeking its meaning from the wise.
Is: change your ways, if you're wise.
Not as a man of honour, sense.
Though they seemed devoid of sense.
Far off, invades her every sense.
Or a young girl's letter, pure, intense.
Our ancient customs shall rehearse.
She never chose to rehearse.
Or else that Demon of my verse.
For the Father of the Universe.
Elle �toit fille, elle �toit amoureuse.
That room to sit in, read, and muse.
For reasons that I'll indicate.
For some malignant blow of fate.
And not abandon me to fate.
Would thank the heavens for their fate.
Tell the story of your fate.
You now consign your fate.
The hour that must decide his fate.
I surrender, and my fate.
Who find November at the gate.
The soul's fire cooling of late.
The dove will soon forget its mate.
Saved from Lethe's darkened spate.
Forever now, they separate.
Their absent masters to berate.
Quarrelling over our estate.
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
Beside some lines still incomplete.
All around her, glittering white.
And dangle the careless lorgnette.
His happiness rare, and absolute.
Fine inns too, all along the route.
Been fluent in her native tongue.
Still quivering there on her tongue.
Yet diplomatic, held his tongue.
Than they, in that celestial blue.
They exit; Lenksy loth to leave.
For your pleasure, so be brave.
Its madness and its rage to live.
Nature's vulgar, over-active.
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The less of use her efforts prove.
To greet them, and to hold her nerve.
The hour when all must say goodbye.
Blind with that mist that veils the eye.
With solemn look, and sparkling eye.
While he devours her with his gaze.
Make way, retrieve a handkerchief.
Consoled her and brought relief.
The inexperienced come to grief.
And gave his neighbour's ribs a dig.
With the others, sweetly dancing.
Girls prefer The Kitten's Wedding.
Became a bore, it seemed, unending.
To her nurse is softly sighing.
Young girls kissing, noise and crushing.
And time gives nurture to the thing.
Considered it a certain thing.
Tanya was blushing, trembling.
Consumptive, four years past, and failing.
I'd not set the ages quarrelling.
As to where he'll spend his evening.
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
Of every joy and suffering.
Day and night, till our next meeting.
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
Prevents her from even moving.
By his better half is lying.
Admire it, as if he were trying.
In human rights, was here all wrong.
Lost now that power of being young.
Clasps in her hand a book, in French.
In procession, sleigh by sleigh.
To hit the head, or break a thigh.
It's not my job to work them through.
Triumphant you'll see winter through.
At the window, read it through.
Silently, I'm doomed to perish.
Appears consumptive in his anguish.
Stripping forests, fierce and harsh.
Tanya lies there, cold as death.
Along the fragile bridge's length.
Present his song-sheet, wish her wealth.
Confess it now, behold: the truth.
Unbridled passion was his truth.
He drew a mourning veil of black.
Its brightly-coloured faro pack.
As if a lightning bolt had struck.
And the flame in her cheek.
Hoot or argue, shout or shriek.
At any more demanding book.
With his pawn took his own rook.
A moment: that was all it took.
Comment; now a question-mark.
Then off to ramble in the park.
Elegy penned a madrigal.
His virgin fire a living coal.
And anticipate his funeral.
One with a fashionable feel.
You showed respect then...now you kneel.
Onegin has outpaced us all.
A birthday party, here a ball.
And all is brilliance at the ball.
Can scarcely wait for night to fall.
Our friends now are in its spell.
Something of what these stanzas tell.
Still forever, fare thee well.
To the stream below the hill.
He's in, and flying to the mill.
Words upon his lips were still.
Listens to the young bloods still.
Arresting her against her will.
No longer forgets itself, at will.
Of rank and age with which the hour's full.
In Onegin's form, and soul.
Her overflowing heart, love's gleam.
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
Enriched by meditative dream.
A harmless, and delightful dream.
Alive again on memory's stream.
With some ready epigram.
All, sombrely, surrounding them.
Four fatal steps, to kill or maim.
Into the meadows, in full bloom.
Is merely vague, and lost in gloom.
With too much life or wit, but charm.
A quiet retreat from the storm.
As saturnine romanticism.
That plague of every modern Russian.
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
To this half-Russian gentleman.
In a soft whisper, gives a moan.
Deep in the woods, than do as bidden.
Their very presence causes spleen.
The naked woods show downy green.
Us then, and I, I was just thirteen.
I made a friend of Eugene then.
A friend of truth: a poet then.
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
I'll feed the proceeds of my pen.
An ironic stanza of how he's smitten.
The Comet's vintage, year eleven.
A soldier-husband, a campaign.
Whatever trouble you are in.
As heaven dictates. You'll love again.
Music's magic, thought, and pain.
Are born a people to whom death brings no pain.
Cold yawns with their icy train.
That fatal sweetness, though in vain.
In seduction's net of sin.
While Eugene, frozen, lingered on.
This nightmare whirling, on and on.
Walks on forever: on and on.
He would neglect and then abandon.
In that, for rustic life to pardon.
A soul so trusting, in that fashion.
And then demands the cotillion.
Tanya had news of the decision.
To punish me with your derision.
A missive that declares his passion.
Stirred a flicker of compassion.
Onegin heard the poet's confession.
Free Chapter Five from more digression.
Breeds fear of reconciliation.
A past acquaintance, and relation.
Endless future tribulation.
In Russian, honouring our nation.
Rise, now, this merits explanation.
To pass a note of assignation.
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Only a mighty conflagration.
Thoughts of her his inspiration.
Stir the same old sweet sensation.
The servant's looks pure irritation.
Experienced but the one reaction.
A paragon of pure perfection.
What reply? A harsh rejection.
Three large kibitkas, by tradition.
A scribbled, and mis-spelt, rendition.
Demanded my full attention.
A new face claims our attention.
Nor calls them to their pen at noon.
Since she was mad for Richardson.
Is certainly no Grandison.
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
As any passing simpleton.
Their sentiments were re-born.
As the half-light turns to dawn.
Trembling like a hunted fawn.
They'd stroll about on the lawn.
Both of them would make him yawn.
The gentle sex is light as down.
A mob-cap and a quilted gown.
Your pride; these feelings shown.
To bee and butterfly unknown.
While virtue won a noble crown.
The censors must have work to do.
Oblige me. Tell me that you'll go.
In yards and fields, loath to go.
All that was settled long ago.
For I stopped sinning long ago.
Tanya should be married too.
And Petushkov - spurned him too.
Nodier's Jean Sbogar too.
Down he'll slip, and throw you too.
A wreath once swayed to and fro.
Though the North affects me so.
They were one instead of two.
I'm ready now for chapter two.
Still eats and drinks enough for two.
Has opened up his serving flap.
Drowned in snow, and buried deep.
- 'My little one, you need to sleep.
Is still to lull dark thoughts to sleep.
Of lovely woman, freakish fop.
On the divan, a riding-crop.
'You must widen the net, my dear.
But not without a blush, I fear.
Is this him, now? She cannot hear.
Its free flow still dark, unclear.
There the Muse first came near.
Sparkles of icy wit appear.
And eighteen nags now appear.
Would haunt the grave, and shed a tear.
Sweeter, in night's embrace, by far.
While nurses screech, and infants roar.
The threatening flames skyward soar.
And dark hair hanging to his shoulder.
They abhor it when we're tender.
To her family a stranger.
And pass sarcastic judgement on her.
Their golden crosses, lifted higher.
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
By this cruel thirst to kill each other.
And died just before his dinner.
In the graveyard's darkest corner.
'I'm happy, am I not?' he'd whisper.
Far off...the Muse followed after.
In silence, plan each other's slaughter.
Her quiet gaze does not falter.
Let me describe her elder sister.
Glutton, bribe-taker, and prankster.
He'll have time still for the latter.
The seal, I have read your letter.
Her face grew pale, and she'd quiver.
Though we'd deny its flight, is over.
Or more fitting, you'll discover.
To attract a passing lover.
To sing of life's dry withered flower.
Squandered youth, life's finest flower.
Meets her calm untroubled air.
All life, before us, seemed so fair.
To say her farewells to the pair.
And, smiling, room's made for the pair.
You'll not find three lovely pair.
To our dance, to our choir.
A street-light, though inferior.
That Tanya can reach the door.
All rise; he rushes to the door.
Glancing stealthily at the door.
And sets her down upon the floor.
Even in the midst of terror.
Or madam' so they all concur.
Then plunged into domestic labour.
Cannot quite eclipse her neighbour.
Neighbour wheezes now at neighbour.
Love is a mere game of Satan's.
Calashes, broughams, and kibitkas.
Poised above the letter's folds.
Our fates lay in Fortune's hands.
Know its worth, and how it ends.
And speaks to them, as to old friends.
To see Onegin dead, my friends.
A dandy, ensign in the Guards.
Made by sorcerers and witches.
To little feet, entrancing ladies.
Beguiles, with its seductive lies.
Wakes, and to the house she flies.
To sighs, or praise, or flatteries.
Embellished by their jealousies.
Stoves shone with ceramic tiles.
The windows rattle in their frames.
In these far less tender times.
And Knyazhnin's imitative rhymes.
Quietly flows. The beetle drones.
From the field, with hushed tones.
Wigs and scarlet-heeled shoes.
At dark fields, mirroring her cares.
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
All those foreign words and phrases.
La morale est dans la nature des choses.
Or Bogdan�vich's light verses.
In her mind she writes, addresses.
Toying happily with the Fates.
With vain ideas the brain conceives.
Was dross enough for many lives.
Then father blessed me, and said yes.
Tatyana, with tear-stained eyes.
A haze of tears to cloud her eyes.
Lensky can't believe his eyes.
They the masters, to his eyes.
When Zaretsky met his eyes.
The opponents wait, with downcast eyes.
Morality is in the nature of things.
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
Queen of mysteries and sighs.
Tanya's the centre of all this.
Ourselves the integer in this.
Welcome with joy the winter's pranks.
And question-marks in several books.
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Its rich sonorous cadence rolls.
Emotion's only fit for fools.
They yet can thrill me in my dreams.
A puzzle that seduced, it seems.
Their empty world, or so it seems.
Out clearly what relation means.
Seeking miracles, for his pains.
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
And even there, at last, vice wins.
His tributes, carefully, he fashions.
Indifferent to its thoughts and passions.
While a soft smile adorns her lips.
Habitually, between their lips.
Her. Galloping, closer it appears.
While her eyes are drowned in tears.
Your passion, letters and your tears.
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
I'd still wander those bright bowers.
It's Heaven's will: I am yours.
From loge or parterre, saw her pass.
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
I now enjoy composing less.
A pedant in the details, no less.
Onegin slumbers on regardless.
Make friends, from sheer idleness.
Were substitutes for happiness.
That folly, that past tenderness.
And carpeted voluptuousness.
Full of innocence and sweetness.
A future world with their caress.
Or a young girl's shy caress.
By candle-light she'd rise and dress.
Or kiss the hem of her dress.
Our hero's previous address.
Nor did her troubled lips compress.
Anticipating future bliss.
Never doubting, lived in bliss.
The faithful friend of wintry nights.
Such were my Yevgeny's thoughts.
That slept beneath her pillow thus.
Their raucous games so frivolous.
She was a girl, she was amorous.
And church-crosses black with daws.
My heart is with the good old days.
To fill up my declining days.
Were changing with the passing days.
The journey took them seven days.
In the morning of our days.
That's my favourite, nowadays.
As lightning in his visage plays.
To offer up the Kremlin keys.
The ballet's beat he should be at.
The crush, the stir there, and the heat.
Wide gloomy brow and bicorn hat.
And ruled him like an autocrat.
From the stove on which it sat.
Who showed him ambiguous respect.
Yet prove as faithless....as their feet.
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
Her former room she can't forget.
Onegin's friendship, so they met.
And died with all he owed unmet.
To mesh him deeper in our net.
Had merely challenged him to fight.
Be more amused by something light.
Restless till the morning light.
The roads are smooth, the burden light.
Alone, in silence. The moon sheds light.
The child of luxury and delight.
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Schiller, to scan by candlelight.
Then dashes off uphill, in flight.
I could endure until the night.
In all her beauty, in the night.
Than that for poet, day or night.
Told in winter, late at night.
Sharing her pillow every night.
'No.' - 'With pleasure.' - 'When?' - 'Tonight.
Sharing pleasures, meals, and thought.
And pierce the very heart of it.
Their tendency to sit, and sit.
Bringing flowers, and ripening fruit.
And argue whether it shows wit.
Like him her dress was elegant.
Or stir her soul, no incitement.
At the least unguarded moment.
There stands a simple monument.
Habit joy's surrogate, heaven sent.
Muddling the wits of all those present.
They wed her, without her consent.
Prose and poetry, in intent.
The serfs applauded his intent.
The pineapple's pure golden unguent.
He's here, my friend, Monsieur Guillot.
Vapour wreathes the china pot.
The bitter record of the heart.
To Lensky's young, receptive heart.
While faster, stronger pounds her heart.
My Tatyana, with all my heart.
Valued feelings, with empty heart.
Finding him sensible, yet smart.
Was made for this very part.
But madden me, spur me to depart.
From the roof, face, shoulders, breast.
And all the dreams the heart holds fast.
Wore the funeral crown at last.
Freed from the burdens of the past.
The bullet shattering his chest.
Snout, snow, storm, warlock, and the rest.
Before I meditate the rest.
By affectation - not the rest.
Her aching heart can find no rest.
And never asked her husband first.
By the will of Zeus the Just.
While pointing out my famous bust.
There's Dominique de Pradt, or Scott.
She wept, endured a coughing bout.
Alone together, at his shout.
In Richardson or in Rousseau.
As, my Onegin, I do you.
Habit would cool my love for you.
And far niente is my law.
Must go, a slave to army law.
That to us is nothing new.
Sped back towards the ball, anew.
Or slipper fuelled the flames anew.
Is forced to curtsey to his bow.
Mother scolds him from the window.
Poor Lensky's reeling from the blow.
Tanya sleeps, at peace below.
Down to the flooded fields below.
Stars the frozen shores below.
Bathed in the moon's enchanted glow.
Pink softness of its sunset glow.
The altar-fire's extinguished now.
I must abandon him for now.
Where Tanya met him, as we know.
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Crunching over morning snow.
And I lament my former sorrow.
With a large general in tow.
Blown by the wind, in swift decay.
As she might on any other day.
'I must?' - 'Yes: for Tanya's birthday.
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
Say farewell without delay.
Sight of her sweet rural display.
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Lest from the chosen path I stray.
Humbly, with him, on life's way.
And high time to be on his way.
Unifying every by-way.
In his memory tucked away.
Then carry the dread thing away.
Rise from the shore, and soar away.
X was a fine man, anyway.
To supply the details, by and by.
Like fence-posts swiftly flashing by.
The horses to the oak nearby.
Were all their constant study.
Rhymes her, in an elegy.
Our stomachs - prompt horology.
By Olga and her lover Lensky.
Although we welcome you, so gladly.
Thirty two paces, precisely.
Surrendered himself completely.
Still bears a hope, a dream darkly.
Called by his neighbour, forcefully.
As wife and mother, faithfully.
He pens a swift, polite reply.
In order to be heard more clearly.
There she stands, helplessly.
Greets the new season, brightly.
Her tears falling constantly.
What mother preaches constantly.
I was bitter, he was gloomy.
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
Plain, devoid of ceremony.
Days and nights an anguished joy.
I suffered without hope or joy.
Three bottles a day, for him, chez V�ry.
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
The Academic Dictionary.
To all my plaintive misery.
Is troubled by its mystery.
That's veiled in deepest mystery.
Of your sublime clear poetry.
Self, and end my poetry.
Goes to raid nature's treasury.
So frowned on in society.
Only serene simplicity.
The charms of sweet simplicity.
Concealing its reality.
With old-fashioned hospitality.
With copious hospitality.
His uncle's frail mortality.
Pleased that they had done their duty.

37-9
38-39
I imagine (say, if I'm right):
Her mother's scarcely reconciled:
By a single thought oppressed:
The Prince presents him, in the end:
A whiteness covering the ground:
Three houses offer a soir�e:
To make a passer-by think twice:
No solace in the silent glade:
The lads run to find a guide:
An Almanack, of year eight vintage:
In winter-time. Please, follow me:
To ease heart's suffering, find fame:
In that sweet golden youth of mine:
My mind in torment, I'm alone:
Then Olga's suitor, Lensky's here:
Unconsciously, apparent there:
A single image as it were:
Prepared for sacrificial fire:
Was heard at the Larin's no more:
No use it seems, any more:
But broods on what he must ignore:
I leave my hero, to his fate:
I share those tears that agitate:
Object of my verses chaste:
More tender even, but as true:
Of comme il faut... (Shiskov, forgive:
Know you as I, share your belief:
Is where that fair song is heading:
'What is it Tanya, dear?' 'It's trifling:
He made his name by simply falling:
I'll set a few words echoing:
Then poke Tatyana, whispering:
She's the subject they're debating:
'Up now, and no procrastinating:
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
Like a reed-pipe, pure, her sigh:
The housekeeper nods her through:
They're here before me, his in truth:
Or my tempter, force of evil:
The pain of time lost, past recall:
You're in a fever...' 'No, I'm not ill:
Though that cranberry juice may kill:
Betrothed though against her will:
Is doomed to feel such love, and moan:
Not a tremor can be seen:
Though once they sang my gifted pen:
Hourly it cheated us, again:
Never once called on them again:
In the princess, Tanya plain:
As the fields by springtime rain:
The missive gave a caustic grin:
The dance-floor was my passion:
You deeply, by my sad confession:
He dreams of, in his exultation:
While he is lost in reflection:
While the last has this reflection:
And on the first page, for inspection:
But - could not. She asked a question:
Is bare, inevitably bores, the reason:
There I too strolled to and fro:
Filling the silences with gossip:
She trembles, burning, in fear:
And then, a sudden thought shines clear:
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
Laid out in alphabetic order:
Stifling a yawn with laughter:
Bordeaux, I tell the waiter:
Inveterate gossip, old-time gangster:
Will be improved to take such loads:
And to deep emotion yields:
As for Tanya this one chimes:
Even as man of honour, features:
(My Reader thinks the rhyme is roses:
In this casual set of verses:
His epitaph discreetly sighs:
But wonders come to her in dreams:
She graces the Assembly Rooms:
Passion's death-march brings tears:
'Nurse, go now.' She swiftly ponders:
Echoing in its emptiness:
Raspberries, sweet redcurrants:
Through our work, of lost genius:
(A feeling tortuous and tenacious:
They keep to their habitual ways:
She hesitates, is filled with doubt:
From foes we can ourselves protect:
My mind....But you're pale as a sheet:
Yet so be it: here I wait:
I'll requite, with your assent:
Distant hopes will sometimes start:
Her to the wide deserted court:
Poor Tanya's youth fading fast:
Believe all things are for the best:
His soul's at peace, his bones at rest:
His pleasure merely to assist:
Is it not true? I often heard you:
Reviving it the following day:
'It's time to rise my child; it's day:
Of whom the age is bound to say:
The ladies seated; then away:
With a familiar melody:
While Onegin turns to Lensky:
He condemned himself severely:
Since it's late, and travel quickly:
The poet awaits Eugene's reply:
Immersed his soul there, utterly:
Calls out his name...uselessly:
'My second?' - echoes Yevgeny:
But if you knew this agony:
To the old dears' perennial cry:
And life a transient mystery:
And know the answer to my query:
And learned life's bland reality:
Above 't(out) � v(ous), Annette';
Ignore the tumult and the chatter';
(You know the fellow, right enough);
(Such is the sex, all Eve's daughters);
But by breakfast, dinner, tea;
Calls her welcome from the sofa;
A liar yet, Lubov Petrovna;
Powder-white Lukerya Lvovna;
Off, in haste, with Pustyakova;
To gaze on, of the former Tanya;
The wealth of nations was his topic;
Read Bayle, as well, the arch-sceptic;
But as it is, our roads are bad;
On her shoulder leans his head;
Spirals upwards, overhead;
Quite dumb, because so tightly-laced;
More often now the sun is shrouded;
Wed, the fire would soon have died;
With Lensky's fate pre-occupied;
So Eugene preached, as she listened;
And Tanya alone, in secret, pined;
The dance to Olga, as he'd planned;
Tatyana such things rejected;
Onegin's heart was deeply moved;
His darling to another wed;
Father of many, still unwed;
Olga he thought would be dismayed;
The only law that I employed;
Of rumours, threats: prophetic, old;
'My darling, well, I'm getting old;
The fortunes of the young are told;
The letter trembles in her hand;
Her failure too to comprehend;
The indulgence of a childhood friend;
The murderer of their dear friend;
Was this what you hoped to find;
Of things none dare leave behind;
With your pure and ardent mind;
All such is alien to my mind;
My life with the domestic round;
A mazurka holds the crowd;
One has a horned and doglike face;
From that dark forbidding face;
Eugene, I first saw your face;
A skeleton haughtily in place;
Tanya replied to each with grace;
Talk seasoned with the salt of malice;
His living tears obscured his glance;
Of roses in some high romance;
Summons the servant for assistance;
Onegin's unexpected presence;
Captivated by its essence;
Of Lensky haunted every glade;
Thoughts of fleas and lemonade;
To lead her to the other side;
She sorrows at the dark divide;
The soft snow reaches to her knee;
A frightful witch with a goatee;
At such and such a date, and age;
It seemed she could barely breathe;
To his defence should slander lie;
And lost in endless reverie;
Five more paces now they take;
Garden, roofs, and fences, pale;
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
Prompt a dream, or article;
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
Speak of this and that a while;
But then at eighteen that's the rule;
Discarding friends to win the same;
A thing the winter cannot tame;
Learnt to endure their colder clime;
Who only ripened in good time;
Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine;
To sing for the guests above the wine;
Who sends me to sleep, all were as one;
To the young hostess, one by one;
Yet as Albani might have done;
Lamenting what is done and gone;
With starlit crowns; the track is gone;
The tale forgotten and the stone;
With all their mysteries laid bare;
The one awaited....he is here;
My two youthful hermits there;
The ladies sit beside the fire;
Yet bored again by conquest's mire;
My Muse with a grand soire;
The whispering girls elsewhere conspire;
Snug as a marmot might desire;
He read, at random, as before;
Onegin counts the hours, once more;
A faithful shadow, nothing more;
How love to the tomb will endure;
Enough! Again, my soul is pure;
Entirely of his vengeful pleasure;
All the shades of wintry pleasure;
At the moon's meaning, each chill phase;
I live, I write but not for praise;
From the heart's true paradise;
And brought the visit to a close;
To call a last farewell: it's late;
And yet it's one I can't translate;
Slides to rest, her fall complete;
Eugene lies, his fall complete;
In vain, your growing appetite;
To be forgiven; trembles; mute;
Not more, with an old blunt cue;
Like smoke dispersing in the blue;
Though over-zealous, it is true;
Yet Tanya scarcely seemed to grieve;
Of cosseting one who's half alive;
Farwell beauty of skies above;
Each one tried to catch her eye;
Triquet rises, with noble gaze;
Sledge rides; and the far-off haze;
Know lives in a dreamy haze;
The noise subsides, and faces glaze;
Its sails a creaking whirligig;
In his grasp, and barely breathing;
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
Must be worn out with travelling;
Frosted glass; and far hills gleaming;
Magpies in the courtyard screaming;
Now I must take to sounder reasoning;
Heedless of their friendly clapping;
Wenches and coachmen swearing;
She heard our Lensky answering;
In yesterday there is no trusting;
To judging other ways of living;
Falling ill like that, and dying;
But then Larina crawled along;
Was thought something of a catch;
Any fish to make a match;
Makes a fresh road with his sleigh;
Dispassionately gave a sigh;
In sheepskin coats with scarlet sash;
Contests their entry in a breath;
And earn a luncheon with them both;
While Cicero I loathed, in truth;
Slumber steals, the years roll back;
The heart alive with kiss and look;
See here too, my old master's nook;
Of deep passions, ancient, dark;
A creature heartless and amoral;
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Woods cloaked with a silver veil;
Then know: I'd rather suffer all;
All still the same as we recall;
Is hateful, in its essence, gall;
The bear has gone; she's in a hall;
The darkened river, vapours fill;
The moon is hidden by a hill;
All was as grist to his mill;
The noble ode's great master still;
He frowns - and everyone is still;
Their questions pointless, dry and dull;
Among the guests; they swiftly twirl;
Covered with sheets of downy gleam;
And with Olga, lost in dream;
A drop of that dark fragrant stream;
Finds delight to come, or doom;
Now cheerful, now full of gloom;
I'm overcome, by pity I mean;
With Evil spirits, a lovely maiden;
Homeward, through the kitchen-garden;
The valleys show a dappled sheen;
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
On summer morns, he'll rise at seven;
She's lost in thought now, once again;
And pulls aside the curtain;
Like a drunken traveller at an inn;
Tired of this cotillion;
Alone, engrossed in calculation;
Make poetry their occupation;
Refused to give rein to affection;
He rode in his lover's direction;
Their loads are placed in position;
Or simply pay him no attention;
Stirred by a solitary emotion;
Loved Russia in the winter season;
Her plight indeed is most forlorn;
Will know the secrets of death's bourn;
I know, her honour with your own;
Worn horns, and a dressing-gown;
Her handkerchief is next to go;
To a soul that perished long ago;
The hero's name I've given too;
By slyly thieving one or two;
The way to turn a verse or two;
Through the wood she flees the bear;
You too, familiar hills, I fear;
The city gates gleam white; they're near;
The creature once again is near;
Loud farewells, with many a tear;
Turns its leaves, no word or tear;
Every day, both near and far;
The cock-crow hails the morning star;
So far away her visions wander;
Mocked what true hearts engender;
Did she pine for him?' She'll wonder;
Gazes, painfully, around her;
And finds Tatyana, no one with her;
The women all gathered to her;
There's no response. He writes another;
Was for a while her entertainer;
And sage of inns, a philanderer;
Semyon Petrovitch, still the miser;
Ivan Petrovich, none the wiser;
All the noise of talk and laughter;
From inside there's noise and clatter;
Or we mistake the things that matter;
Though blank pages would be better;
Fables: Zadeka though was better;
By the nose; deceive the clever;
Buoyant as hope, that soars forever;
For him alone, the eternal lover;
A table's readied for the pair;
The clock strikes ten. He's at the door;
In shirt and night-cap, by the door;
Taunting the watch at midnight's door;
Clatters his chair against the floor;
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Of our world grant me honour;
Be amused by our vices;
Raises his pistol slowly, glances;
Of Moldavia's gloomy reaches;
Their hopes, their pranks, their reveries;
Old companions' cruelties;
St Chariton's, the carriage brakes;
Agitates the candle-flames;
To shelter lovers' trysts aspires;
We all possess Napoleon's features;
All he sees and hears, he notes;
To Olga, his hours he devotes;
Whose serfs live miserable lives;
Blessed our first poor offerings;
Those first successes gave us wings;
Secret rendezvous in sleighs;
With the man of honour, and sighs;
'They're all past they're best' he sighs;
Seeks Olga's lovely hand in his;
Your perfection in all this;
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
The meadows and the slopes of hills;
Are only instruments and tools;
Uncomfortable, unsmiling pearls;
The little foot I touch it seems;
Morals makes us nod, not sins;
Now a provincial girl, she steps;
Faithfully follow in your footsteps;
Your slightest glance; your smiling lips;
Fresh linen: take time by the ears;
Pluck the gold earrings from her ears;
He hated girls' neurotic fears;
In exchange, her hopes and fears;
Guillot, his French valet, appears;
A distant strand of singing soars;
To make an end, than take the waters;
Abodes of demons and of monsters;
On the highway, snorts and quivers;
The breathless meeting of young lovers;
A swarm of beauties, cool betrayers;
In the dining room downstairs;
Calling Moscow to its labours;
His own features in the glass;
The soul, wreathed in its sadness;
His fleeting glance of tenderness;
Pale, alone, and in distress;
To make of that; her own distress;
Indifferent to wintry delights;
Breathing the frosted air of nights;
Nomadic tribes in humble tents;
A trouble-maker, and malicious;
Or that the stupid are malicious;
Rewarding the merely meretricious;
Subject now to passion's laws;
Far into the silent hollows;
The simple lore of bygone days;
The one she wore in former days;
The glittering frost on shiny days;
With its hissing, foaming ways;
Ten times, and never miss a beat;
The honour paid it is not great;
Or in solitude, and quiet;
Young girls, hurrying, fell quiet;
She gazes round; the room grows light;
Travel's easy, a delight;
The soul with torment and delight;
Lift her trailing hem, in flight;
Then replaced, their case shut tight;
To love the ages must submit;
Slippers, dressing-gown: this instant;
Those feelings, so long quiescent;
Half-jesting, or with true intent;
De Sta�l, Bichat, and Tissot;
There were some favourites he kept;
Grants an indifferent crowd her art;
To speak the language of the heart;
For the passions of the heart;
Out all the content of her heart;
A Tsimlyansky, for a toast;
On that very couch, and rest;
Strange his languor, there, at rest;
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
With that her weary voice gave out;
Till the flame is dying out;
And bony finger, point her out;
In secret, or with raucous shout;
He nods - and there's a mighty shout;
Petushkov next, the local beau;
Farewell nature, my joy, adieu;
My Moscow chose not to bow;
Towards the valley down below;
Their thirst, clink pitchers in the flow;
O Muse, receive your blessing now;
Covered by the powdery snow;
From two to thirty, in a row;
That bitter anger, that cold brow;
We too, we too, the same old way;
To running things the modern way;
Steps delicately on her way;
Dowagers smiled as she passed by;
The crunch of snow...someone goes by;
Sipping the hour as it slips by;
Couples sweeping wildly by;
The object of his constancy;
On my long and silent journey;
That the country bores you, sadly;
Or played a part unwittingly;
Dealt with her sympathetically;
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
She scarcely breathed; made no reply;
Trembled at omens, anxiously;
For the waltz, and stepping lightly;
He valued such things little, rightly;
No, to be with you constantly;
He'd called, was pleasant company;
Tanya, like a lovesick boy;
That all last winter gave you joy;
The dullards we deem necessary;
Or intellect prompts mockery;
Survey provincial mystery;
Stares, grows mad with jealousy;
By self-satisfied nonentity;
Achieving peace at last, and plenty;
By me alone his soul was moved!"...?
What's this he's hearing? Can it be...?
That young girl...is it a dream...?
'And then what became of Olga?
Fresh hope on which my heart is fed?
Tatyana! Whose name is revealed?
Who to his grave the poet hurled?
Fault was charming, though it grated?
'Is he the same, or has he mellowed?
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
To our measure, in the end?
On whom alone shall we depend?
What passes now through her mind?
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
As at the feast he seemed to be?
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Lost in our rural solitude?
'To whom, my dear, who is this he?
And what of her sister, where is she?
Where shall we find your like?
Who is the man? Is this Eugene?
Go riding on the empty steppe?
'Where have you been, Onegin, where?
My springtime's over, in the sere?
Is he as strange now as before?
Poor Tanya, in her new disguise?
The heavy friendship of a spouse?
Was no surprise: so simple, true?
Perhaps, for him...And yet, why grieve?
A fierce desire to love and live?
What stirs there, hidden from the eye?
Spend the time indoors, reading?
This day to come, what will it bring?
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
But, the outcome of their meeting?
Why are you so unforgiving?
And you (its rhyme forever) youth?
Can it be love, the care of youth?
Golden springtime of my youth?
The dream! Where's sweet elusive truth?
You preached: the strong to the weak?
Who but the hero of our novel?
Hearing fresh whispers sigh and call?
Where will my young idler call?
To imbibe it, friends: recall?
Are all your relations well?
Would recognise the tender girl?
Alight in his cold, torpid soul?
Where are the horses taking him?
Grey trampled slush; yet, what's his whim?
Her soul was waiting...but for whom?
Why not view the house, or garden?
In little girls of scarce thirteen?
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
And no confusion, no compassion?
How shall I add to my confession?
A spirit tuned to all creation?
Your pure, pensive incantation?
What can one do in such a season?
And thirty years the prize I earn?
Can it be true there's no return?
But what on earth is one to do?
When will my wings begin to soar?
Thoughts and feelings, noble, tender?
When shall I ever loose my tether?
'Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
Prompting your malicious laughter?
And why? What am I striving for?
'What do I haunt the ballet for?
For his love, his latest verses?
Dealt you by the cruel Fates?
And halts: what's this, before his eyes?
Believes completely in her dreams?
Why now pay me these attentions?
Years long gone, now faded embers?
His days and dreams, what man recovers?
For what we see, not what is ours?
Surrender's language, rare excess?
Who in your verse is your goddess?
Was it for you all that distress?
Why did you come, to disturb us?
Who is never bored by us?
So charming and so perilous?
Scorn Moscow? Is the world so marvellous?
I once spent my sweetest days?
Issued from your heart's redoubt?
Why now? What brings you to my feet?
Madman, could your heart forget?
On what spring flowers are you set?
Her way again in soulful flight?
This the message your note brought?
My friends, where's the sense in it?
Midst oft repeated amusement?
In his face? Why is he present?
You don't care for them a lot?
For all of that now, have we not?
'Shall we begin?' 'Begin, why not?
Follows the promptings of her heart?
Make him a favourite at Court?
Had she found the word at last?
Is now quite withered by the blast?
Paid tribute with a tear. 'Who's next?
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
How can we not love our Moscow?
And all this world dark below?
Why must you pursue me now?
Revealed that calm, indifferent brow?
Many a night, and many a day?
'I write - what more is there to say?
Reader, you'd know what they say?
For all those years long sped by?
A lexicon, a parody?
When my head ached so painfully?
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
'Or did her sorrow vanish swiftly?
You're really going? And so swiftly?
To your heartfelt, despairing cry?
You, gleams of sacred poetry?
His knowledge of her frailty?
Why then consider Tanya guilty?
ONEGIN'S LETTER TO TATYANA
THE GIRLS' SONG
And so in careless rapture I
TATYANA'S LETTER TO ONEGIN
And then he'll dress, may write a letter, a
Though Racine, or Seneca
'Why did you leave so early,' Olga
Poor Lenksy! Not for long did Olga
Turning his troubled gaze on Olga
Where no face showed of Diana
While Zhukovsky's Svetlana
That with sheer beauty charms Tatyana
With Aunt Pelageya Nikolevna
Grandmamma and grandpapa
Softly humming: Benedetta
Departs the room, yet asks Anisya
Deep in all things economic
But hush! You hear? Our sternest critic
Though I fail to see what's romantic
Inconsequential dreams; the arc
At last near dawn, his weary head
The love-god, Lel, overhead
Great shelves of books he read and read
In his deft satire: Is all you've read
The golden coals, a slender thread
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
She turns them all down, instead
You left no trace, but loved instead
Nodding, he laid it down instead
Was not enamoured, thought him mad
The pile of books, then the bed
At last he stirs, sits up in bed
At the Larins had produced
They took offence, and once offended
Only a strange sad pallor clouded
Kissed, and fussed about, and crowded
For all of that monotonous breed
What more is needed? All agreed
And she, whose lines I sketched
At Whitsuntide, their tears they'd shed
And then, if suddenly she spied
Pistols gleam, hammers are knocked
He who had never once concealed
But as, at the back porch, was saddled
All memory of him swiftly fled
She samples them, and as if called
The spring revived him. He hastened
A caricature he next designed
The lengthy silence ends, refined
Where the roots are intertwined
The stately pile was nobly planned
In matters of duelling reckoned
I await you: one look turned
Now free, my verse no longer feared
Penned by Lensky, and as he offered
Nature waited, icy-fingered
When to the flag we have gathered
So Yazykov, when you're inspired
Once calling on an aunt, the bored
In the end he too grew bored
And an old man whom she'd ignored
By Olga, and as one enraptured
She brought her glories, never ceased
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
A London dandy safely classed
In our regard, has left us blessed
He was no fool; appreciated
Flattered her, smiled, ingratiated
For forty years had berated
By Fyodor Tolstoy, decorated
You handsome albums, illustrated
So, Vladimir more captivated
And when nurse had collected
At home, his pistols are inspected
Here too was Prolasov, so stunted
Opponents! They'd not long been parted
Wept for her daughter; as they parted
His character was executed
But often to the window glued
Who longing to unite them, grieved
Washing, with fresh snow, removed
In time (who knows?) I might have viewed
In masculine attire displayed
Into the dark may have conveyed
His tender look still conveyed
My lively Muse and I enjoyed
The place where my poor nurse was laid
But enough, enough: you've paid
Remember what Dimitriev said
Her tender fingers never held
Glimpsing from the distant field
Then Monsieur taught the child
Two slender feet...Now sad and cold
Alas! Her look seems to hold
In mysterious legends that told
Call Praskovya, Pauline, and would
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
And putting out a trembling hand
As if a cold, an icy hand
But where, in what deserted strand
The poet is no more...the end
Like Venus if she'd condescend
I beg you, go: and you'll defend
With your self-image? He may offend
The passer-by can read the legend
But you, Bordeaux, are a friend
I read to my old nurse, who'll lend
On you alone I must depend
A full three hours at least he'd spend
In life's fresh glow, he still could find
I can't see it. Here's what you'll find
And yet I was amazed to find
Pots and basins, jugs; the kind
May be construed by your mind
I must confess I scarcely mind
Of two tall pines; where waters wind
Onegin searched the cupboards, found
A role as husband, father; found
Although inseparable I've found
Blows chill; the sleeping groves, around
A pure devotion to the good
And for a long while Tanya stood
Thus, you never would have heard
Now, for the first time, I reward
And jealously the world afford
Eugene had found, with what word
My style is rendered quite absurd
As a storm will often shroud
Those with other meaning. He
Could kindly fate for me prescribe
'Could I happily circumscribe
Is to aim at his pallid face
As you leave the village, a place
That inspired soul knew, a space
Holy friends of the human race
And therefore my fall from grace
Horace
Yet she'd not a single trace
The swift kibitkas' runners trace
To the hostess they raise the chalice
Back to his regiment, her choice
Oh Brenta! No: yet I'll rejoice
And soon our Olga's chiming voice
The power of some life-giving voice
And in the bath-house, in a trice
Lifting the gauzy veil may glance
Present the clearest evidence
All's tedium, madness, and pretence
The talk turns with quiet persistence
I was born for quiet existence
My being in family existence
Sees he is loved, feels the force
Where the mute and blood-stained shade
The sign of the cross she made
Nor Baratynsky, who has made
Here's the first use of it made
Hovers, still these girls will hide
The bearded outrider's astride
Of my verse by the water's side
While both indoors and outside
He'd addressed a multitude
Out of its waxen cell, the bee
Breeds ducks and geese, while at his knee
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
The coachmen by the fire free
And, in the aching heart, set free
Was he as vigorous and carefree
But one and all, in truth, agree
Surely, my Reader, you'd agree
Chapter Three
Behind the stump of a nearby tree
But, listen, Lensky, when shall I see
One a cockerel's head; and see
While age, in spectacles, can see
And gazing in adoration see
Had Tanya had the power to see
Don his spectacles to see
Where fashion's loyal devotee
He who yawns away his life
(Though he thought that country life
Now, when Eugene reached the age
Oh, he had loved as in our age
- 'Dear Cousin!' - 'Sit: it's like a page
Restlessness, an urge for change
- 'Then send your grandson, and he
In deep forgetfulness, does he
In his soul, so worthless he
Is ignorant of deceit, and still she
For several days thereafter she
The rustling curtain as we breathe
He'd not allow a man to die
Eugene continues to lie
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
Or some poetic reverie
(Lepage's make, of course) and tie
His rest; girl reapers, keen to slake
And fail to offer a word, to make
In ease and innocence I take
It's late; and time for him to take
Where the ploughman likes to take
Saying: 'You wrote to me, I broke
What dreams or cards portend, grew pale
The radiance dies: there the vale
She wanders through a snowy vale
Whose capital he's proved able
Once more resigned to being idle
Derzhavin, lingering here a while
The foolish dreamer sees them whole
But, God, what tedium to sample
In spirit, he abandons me
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Around the hour the French name
No two men were less the same
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
By the lake I'll walk, the chime
Until his Breguet's sleepless chime
Our grandchildren think it no crime
Flashes by, and in no time
Yet in frozen winter time
Since time began; so, he'd resume
Through my garden, once urbane
Seated by the window pane
But, perhaps this winter scene
Like the majestic moon serene
And all their voices now combine
Peace and quiet - such the fine
Their family, or the hounds, no shine
Here's his study, he'd recline
And sees herself the heroine
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Byron was there - and novels, one
Absorbed by remorse at things done
We think the others noughts, alone
One loves no longer; one alone
Racing the meadowlands alone
Our Yevgeny was not alone
Another? ....No, no there's none
Though great, our poet is immune
Yet Tasso's murmured octaves are
If I were a poet, as you are
Eavesdropper, don't you dare
A black-cowled monk, or if a hare
Ready to save his honour, share
For fortune-telling they prepare
Haunted by one thought, his stare
But now a clink of spurs, and here
Trusted also his friends were there
Recalling many a lost love there
On a pine-branch bending there
Heaped with snow; glittering there
That I should wed...all paths from there
With glittering eyes Onegin there
Go, arm in arm to table, where
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Carried in dream to that land where
Onegin, to the theatre where
Can it be true, and not a mere
Nurtured by the mob, no dire
White Moscow, stone and blazing fire
Though he'd occasionally misfire
With Russian hammer, he'll aspire
With sighs or flattery, to aspire
Despite all efforts, or aspire
He lacked the passion and desire
But Lensky, lacking the desire
The rural dancers now retire
Wished sincerely to acquire
Won't kiss the ladies' hands, what's more
Every dawn produces more
Malfil�tre
That table nearer; I'll be sure
Where lovers of life's simple pleasure
As for finding ancient treasure
In their hours of work and leisure
Our bored Yevgeny's place of leisure
Drive the dogs off, to ensure
For rural silence, where the lyre
I'll breathe free, take my ease
Ingenious London without cease
I leave such quiet haunts as these
Worn out by the ballroom's noise
Alas! From life's dark furrows rise
On reading their sad tale - surprise
So morning brought no great surprise
No matter, hope in childish guise
Society, in short? What I'd advise
To avoid the usual expense
Of post-horses, it made sense
His partnering Olga too, what sense
Some long fairytale's wild nonsense
Onegin (once more I rehearse
All forgotten, and rehearse
In the names that we rehearse
On his own madness, to immerse
Love's enchantments: and my verse
That the substance of my verse
Which their friends will all endorse
All hope is lost! He leaves: a curse
The bench beside her, where the nurse
Though the house is empty, use
So on Shrove Tuesday always ate
Turn to my hero, lest his fate
He dropped his gaze, began to hate
Change of tone, starts to relate
And now I must congratulate
Gambler-in-chief, an intimate
What foolishness, and what complete
Of nobility of soul; yet spite
I only wish the words I write
Who freely, ardently, once wrote
Such was Olga...you can paste
Enlightenment has been a waste
She gazes: a discarded cue
Before the mirror, then would leave
Love might have found a way to save
Two hearts there are, two that grieve
Chapter Five
Youth is a fever, let's forgive
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
My lips from hers will softly prove
Forced between her lips, will serve
Near young Tatyana, whom we
The muddy pool, my friends, that we
And still transparent to the eye
And let the proud and mocking gaze
Since, foretelling to my gaze
The sound of hooves! ...Sent to freeze
Nearby (when the furrows ooze
I thought Onegin's talk disturbing
A decent sort, though yet conceding
He dances, nonchalantly guiding
How heavy the emotion weighing
My eyes in vain seek out the thing
Betray me, while you poor thing
And, exiled for that very thing
Rushes to lift her, swiftly sheathing
Takes to the garden, walking
Issue an angry challenge, thinking
Thus the country view of hooking
Now imagination's dealing
They've come to an old aunt who's ailing
In the old way, maids foretelling
Dusk falls, the samovar is gleaming
One melancholy jester leaning
And fed you cake!' Tanya's barely listening
'How Tanya's grown! Your christening
With not a thought in the morning
But now, from out the vales of morning
Always the Frenchman, had to bring
A memory to the mind may bring
No more, dear feet, of wandering
Far off a choir of girls sing
She never took to caressing
Faithlessness was not amusing
He's off to Talon's, calculating
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
On my heart, to feel the straying
Here an ambassador conveying
The matchmaker spent two weeks trying
All's peaceful; in the parlour, vying
Like a Bacchante, danced along
To use their nags, and so prolong
Freedom's champion, ever strong
The sober-headed, for whom each
Our Russian language, and yet each
Make conversation, and to teach
Then by the stream, beneath the beech
I'll record the honest speech
Petrarch
Onegin fires...the clock on high
And with southern oceans nigh
Since even he at times would sigh
Silently to yawn and sigh
We'd never heard the word. One sigh
It's fun, despite the pain he's in, though
We'll show off Tanya, a pity though
In works of charity, all through
Their coachmen, seated, wield the lash
Show respect to, love, and relish
Conceive it. No one here to cherish
But by rule, and he was loath
Now full of grief he lacks the strength
To help her cross, she gathers strength
'Eugene! Ah!' - Light as a wraith
Besides, the enthusiasm of youth
For he was victim from his youth
Alas it's sad to think that youth
The country caused the same ennui
      L� sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi
He brings' - she murmurs - 'and I lack
Had gripped her heart, as if a black
Flings wide the door, he holds a sock
Yet Terpsichore's foot I'd seek
So a poor butterfly will seek
His dream's mute monument, a link
His dumb remorse; an open book
The old man had no time to look
Two, in uniform; he hardly took
Now an underline; now a dark
It's pleasant with a sharp remark
What ails him? Is it some strange coal
Life was a riddle, and its goal
Lensky, for a funeral
And to delight the sensual
Volume Three of Marmontel
The fire dies down; the ashes veil
Cries, the clash of glasses, all
But the pleasantest thing of all
And lost in misty moonlight all
A little pale and thin, but all
Cheerfully, I'd give my all
That Onegin is not me, recall
'I'm weeping....if you still recall
Lord Byron's portrait, by a small
The clouded moon, and on the wall
For your enlightenment, to spell
Today we know, truth to tell
But it grows late; the wind as well
He thought: what folly to work ill
Tried to write, it makes him ill
Windows pale within, that fill
The invalid's kind words must fill
The sarcastic and the chill
All this fresh to Onegin, till
Arrived, asks Guillot if he will
All is over: to your will
Summon sufficient self-control
The shadows thicken, till a dreadful
Yet a modern Regulus, the soul
Or that a fiery headstrong soul
He ought to do so - will your soul
He'd made pencil marks, his soul
The doubts that stirred in his soul
And on the rustic bench's gleam
Shines with mist. Here a stream
The lonely grove where a stream
From the cradle, the slow stream
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
Walk? The countryside you roam
Here, one who'd aim an epigram
Follow in Petrarch's steps, seem
Then like a very sage could seem
That young girl, it would seem
What can I hope for? With what aim
Yet sleep had barely laid its claim
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
And hungry wolves, that loom
A nightingale, from woodland gloom
They crowd into the drawing room
Always together, in her room
No one finding any harm
As if to raise a magic charm
Each falling there as they form
The vile and venomous worm
Displays a hopeless egotism
He found it in some dusty album
It summons up respect, one can
And so my Tanya began
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
Vladimir Lensky, is the man
A profile of contemporary man
Old tales they were, fables laden
Oh, horror! Better safely hidden
Would meet in the morning, keen
And Tanya all attention, keen
In that face Eugene was keen
A time when, pursued by spleen
On many pages could be seen
Was just a lad, if you could have seen
To prejudices rarely seen
To which we dedicated then
You visited them twice, and then
Through the frosted glass, and then
From his estate, perhaps: and then
All pierced her to the core; and then
Not daring to stop, for then
And rosy as Aurora when
Are all such things quite alien
Shall I depict with faithful pen
The eager nonsense I may pen
Chapter Seven
She can't. And why? Because she's given
But she had heard of them a dozen
Full of love's foolishness, again
Our wanderings and again
Now, I no longer rush to stain
Yet, after brief greeting, to begin
Struck by an icy chill, Onegin
A true Childe Harold, my Onegin
The poet burning with opinion
Who's affectation caused occasion
Bringing the science of persuasion
Yet the book has no pretension
Both had known the play of passion
The science of the tender passion
Pride's cold politeness, the procession
And then demand an expression
Meanwhile Onegin's first session
We've all acquired some education
But her mounting trepidation
Moscow....what depths of fascination
Now Tanya stares in fascination
A moment since, imagination
But drawing-room pre-occupation
Yet my Eugene's preoccupation
The shy, sweet girl whose adoration
Generally their conversation
But the world's scornful expectation
Who has cooled love's agitation
The Prince has sent an invitation
Between them every disputation
First: he'd erred in his reaction
But empty fancy's vain distraction
Reminded me of my attraction
At one of whom his recollection
An author of romantic fiction
What of it? Well, my true intention
To challenge him I've no intention
Seizes a book, with rapt attention
Of pure regret, his only notion
To journalists for their consumption
Indoors the maid will softly croon
No lorgnettes were trained upon
Byron
- Thank God - bit by bit, to learn
Sweet as the kiss of love, that's born
An ancient house or one new-born
He darns, old spectacles adorn
Did the singer sadly mourn
Or un-consoled by the return
Flows in turbid streams that run
The days flashed by - and with the sun
It's: "I won't." Then on her own
Of someone other, never own
And the young city lady, down
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Among the many doomed to go
Just as at wars of long ago
His lines breathe love alone, and no
And I've seen other beauties too
And fled through the fields, that too
A little note then for her hero
Joy of our hours of leisure, so
A host of nymphs around her, so
He yawned inordinately, and so
To suffer at your feet and so
Chapter Two
Or frighten with a glance or two
More than once in white night-cap
But Petersburg that restless heap
Visit my humble corner, keep
A dark-eyed, white-skinned maid to keep
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
The polished table shines, I fear
Now night and day he will appear
To whom the passing forms appear
Will you not stop to shed a tear
Always gave three balls a year
'Then, in that rural wasteland, far
Yet brighter shines the moon by far
Friends and enemies from afar
Born, in a garret, of a liar
All the British Muse's lumber
And stranger still, behold a spider
In red night-cap, a second rider
The girls' true idol, at least the older
The one on Hades' Gate: Surrender
His father had a fine career
And when he wanted to refer
But in the end came to prefer
Or from greedy lips, remove her
Yet now we only see in her
Onegin quietly carries her
Necker
It had trapped him, like a mourner
Meanwhile another landowner
Yet at dawn the restless sleeper
Reveal my soul, and thereafter
His uncle lay at death's door, better
In fact he soon received a letter
She knows she must not see him, ever
He was the practical joker, ever
In romance, the first time ever
But kept the juiciest stories ever
O Human Race! Why such a fever
One that, beyond the grave, never
Neighbours shook their heads, forever
Dusk falls. The sky is dark. The river
Her eyelids showed not a quiver
Sings all night, wild roses cover
And our Katenin moreover
The safest place for a lover
How blessed is the modern lover
Nature passages of a power
Whether I fall struck by the power
True, contempt should rightly answer
But...my mother's tears, her prayer
Or waste your efforts on the air
But suddenly a draught of air
Light as a swallow, and as fair
Kept the books, and shaved the hair
Grip the reins, and from her hair
Ah, they made me long despair
Says yes and no, but never sir
A priceless treasure, here to stir
Olga was the first to stir
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Where you too were nourished or
A ballroom tyrant by the door
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Chapter Four
'To me Onegin all this splendour
Did I so long with painful ardour
So, enjoy the fleeting hour
Like bees that leave the hive, and pour
Had to present his hero as
How I longed to be those seas
(Those Memoirs), and two Petriads
A mere five hundred years) our roads
Sits with head downcast, still holds
Sang of all the far-off lands
The hill slope and where it ends
So scarcely breathing, she descends
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Which translates as: he intends
Onegin smiles as he extends
All is still, only the guards
Though a provincial town affords
On nightmare, like those ancient feuds
There was a time when envious faces
Used the nasal 'n' in places
To our hero, who concedes
Surrounded by its ancient trees
Then from the heights she sees
The secrets of the grave, the pages
Then the servant's noise presages
Blessing Russia's ruts and ditches
An embittered mind that seethes
Not for long were lovely ladies
Where cupolas raise to glowing skies
Yet now they're near. Before them lies
So be it! My fate now lies
Where his honoured dust now lies
'Is this forever', sadly cries
Childhood mischief, petty glories
Were not her forte; horror stories
How well she carries out the duties
This whole exhausting journey takes
Such as they are, view these extremes
Then tea arrives. Not by the chimes
Have played a rubber; and eight times
Land of bewitchment! In past times
The blare of music, and the fumes
We've no use for Parny's rhymes
Here's a wood: in beauty, pines
She lies for hours, while sleep escapes
Sleepless, at the window, stares
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
No, never in the fiercest fires
Of tortured youth and its desires
Without doubt, Eugene adores
Askance his opera-glass now centres
The millions of two-legged creatures
Is there a poet who rehearses
Up through the flue, sparkling glasses
She sighs and in herself possesses
One foot planted, pirouettes
They dine out at the relatives
On the stone, with his own eyes
She shudders, silent, yet her eyes
For here, elated by the prizes
Aurora, rosy-fingered, brings
The language of the gods, her songs
Her to that hellish crew - and peals
Eugene flings wide the door, reveals
Whitening the oak boughs, and fills
Olga's there, and quietly fills
The shining tea-cups, never spills
All spiteful gossip, yet his tools
Night falls, and the moon patrols
I know: they'd like to force our girls
Brighter than finest parquet gleams
Alone, where the meadow gleams
He sweetened with delightful dreams
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
While behind the window streams
Wrapped in mist and gloom, it seems
I still remember, and it seems
Southward stretch the caravans
While drowned by frantic violins
Having escaped those stormy regions
Administering the same corrections
Because, rich, noble, the conventions
A mirror on the moon, but learns
It stifles her...her spirit yearns
And, heedless of the cold, she turns
For rural life, and memory turns
Triquet; Buyanov then steps
But Tatyana, scarcely hears
All in our sage's cell appears
Yet he stays; readier, it appears
And then one wet shoe disappears
Though she's unmoved by it, no tears
What thorns, not roses, through the years
For my dreams, my tender years
The storm that shook my soul for years
Ozerov's tragedies for years
A single boat with outspread oars
Among the snowdrifts, roars
Perhaps the troubled soul remembers
Wanders among forest choirs
That simple stall, with oaken floors
A seething torrent, foaming, pours
Turning on the alien mass
The husband was the first to pass
I love their little feet, confess
Though, dear Reader, I confess
Of your perfection too, no less
His generous spirit still could bless
One day, to illuminate and bless
Now, while predictable and mindless
Wheeling in its circles, tireless
Worse, with a joyless madness
And yet with a pretended coldness
So be it! Neutral nothingness
Rewards with its fond caress
Meanwhile in his morning dress
Lest the world, her spouse, should guess
On his sledge the yard-boy seats
What if your pistol-shot inflicts
Whose rash look or sneer conflicts
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
Maid of riper years, accepts
The dead man buried priest and guests
Tales from their past. The guests
Where now, exchanging looks, the guests
The presentation of the guests
She pays no attention to their guests
Unbearable to see before us
I'd not have known you, and thus
In silent joy, of night's bounteous
Of a living work, as dubious
Istomina stands, serious
He was pursued by a vexatious
Their violence seems ridiculous
Parkland, overgrown, soft shadows
A bottle pops; the wine now flows
She sees him clear; and other days
But even in her earliest days
But only, it seems, from my days
Lightly, he falls. His gaze betrays
To deviate from established ways
Write novels in established ways
Of simple speech and rural ways
Glad now that his former ways
All mankind's malicious ways
He breathes the air of freedom, at
Strange presentiments: even the cat
Glass on glass to drench the heat
As his watch's chimes repeat
And ignominiously repeat
As though we can never treat
Napoleon, arms crossed, with that
Jugs of cranberry juice, all that
I can't go out: my legs they're what
Zaretsky establishes what's what
Enchanted me: I often sat
And gladly lived a life of debt
Have had sufficient time to act
A great fat goose her red-webbed feet
In wild repentance at her feet
And seething abyss at her feet
Seeking their charms she goes to meet
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
Had opened... 'Yet the death is sweet
The general, flattered by the diet
First rouse his vanity and let
He sought them without joy, and met
Echoing down the years. The poet
Or alternatively the poet
His heart consumed with regret
Tanya with gratitude, and yet
Had vanished long ago, and yet
Yields to it like a child, as yet
Might have climbed Parnassus yet
Can this girl who's scarcely yet
Her prudent husband, swiftly left
By Olga, though yet not bereft
Chapter Eight
Now from the shed at morning light
Shines above, its tranquil light
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
And leaves them in the gloomy light
His virulence, his scorn, alight
Winter! ...The peasant with delight
They say there's no sweeter delight
Indifferent to the world's delight
Treads the skies.' Well now, I might
To read an epigraph, and might
Blessed is he...although she might
He'd feared lest his opponent might
In winter when the shades of night
And turning morning into night
Drives home again, where that night
Deep, in the translucent night
He seems to see his Olga, bright
Then my student cell was bright
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
Frantic and quivering, caught
He who feels, is quickly taught
A prize which Tatyana bought
He who's lived, he who's thought
A wandering pedlar had brought
Now hostility had brought
From misty Germany he brought
Looks about her...fate has brought
With sad expectancy would wait
Two bullets - nothing else - await
A fresh demon will inhabit
Praised his sheer daring; he could hit
And, there? .....Around a table sit
A tenderness. Whether he meant
All that you sincerely meant
Yet were they wholly innocent
From the fog, the horse can scent
Applies himself with diligent
Alas, on every stray amusement
(And philosophic sentiment
When progress and enlightenment
And never bothered for a moment
At home he renders it apparent
At first they seemed indifferent
Is it not you, this heaven-sent
Presses her hand - his whole intent
If I'd reserved a hope, content
But was dear Yevgeny content
Even the fashion page, could not
And with a smile, and an abrupt
Enter the Prince, to interrupt
Blessed with skill, the Muses' art
Derzhavin he who tuned his art
Guarding with unconscious art
Singing, from your burning heart
By Yevgeny not for his heart
Or make this painful dream depart
It would be painful to depart
Forgive me: I've loved from the start
So a seed begins to start
Vladimir replies. They start
She falls to the snow, the bear alert
At times be silent, then in sport
Make an escape, shield his breast
Russian pancakes, and they'd fast
Can it be true, that crown at last
Because she's trusting, and honest
I thought that freedom and rest
Bear, bridge, darkness, fir and forest
Sip coffee; or at his request
Eight times our heroes at their whist
He'd no desire to dig the dust
While Hussars, on leave, have but
And, in vain tedium, I play out
Freezing cold, a menu's put
Here acknowledged dandies strut
Fine...They're all well, and send you
And you my constant care, yes you
Dimitriev
Griboyedov
'Bring me ink and paper, draw
From here, plunged in thought, he saw
The guileless stories, not a few
Thinking every place you view
Or Idol mio, till his review
Are you as you were? Have new
My foolish pupil now knew
Under her parent's gaze she grew
Of all that sentimental stew
No lady's ever deigned to show
No madrigals from Lensky flow
He knew enough I would allow
In that room, where the aged fellow
The paths of humble prose I'll follow
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
To cheers, applause. Tanya now
My life was but a pledge till now
Was she the one who but now
To listen to you, and to know
From the neighbouring hills, the snow
Winter stalled its fall of snow
Glittering, the first winter snow
The twin lights of the carriage throw
'And he...but we've time tomorrow
Live in glory...ah, but sorrow
Chapter Six
The long-delayed departure day
So our heedless race today
I know it's in your power today
She'd never argue: Let's delay
Yet had compassion a part to play
Not for the first time, made display
Yet none of it, the whole display
Though it's true some woman may
We'll move the mountains, and pay
By that window: now I pray
Though he'd no wish to betray
With children of all ages, say
From his uncle's man, to say
You're unsociable, they say
Increase love's value, find a way
In the same lively, carefree way
Her father, mother, not her way
And slowly they both made their way
Are treated in the kindest way
Simply to pass the time away
Frightening a timid love away
Turns, page in hand then sings away
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
Her word away, she's pledged already
When a fashionable lady
Until, such good friends were they
Startling the wild ducks till they
No reason why a man of energy
But we've so many neighbours, why
Of how it lives, the what and why
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel. Prince Vyazemsky
Returning to his home, young Lensky
Flushed and satisfied. Poor Lensky
Baratynsky
Zhukovsky
Olga too yawns by him, sadly
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
That can't be a problem, surely
I tore my heart away, completely
He leaves the ball, and pensively
Denizen of the wings, he'll fly
His prison, loyal, prepared to fly
As ardent glances swiftly fly
Or, less harshly, like a butterfly
Endeared himself more readily
Some decent neighbouring family
A simple Russian family
To read him, nor preferred really
I might commit a daring folly
To burn - while reason forcefully
Or by Lethe blissfully
Finds her Ideal, and fitfully
All their romance seen dimly
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
Repeating to it solemnly
And rightly so: For sitting sternly
And scratch her neck, and stubbornly
That, I'm denied; and, simply
But not quite yet. Although I dearly
Speak of him, and endlessly
Castigated ruthlessly
Her mother always valued greatly
The accounts were done, and swiftly
Tanya on her luck, but swiftly
While, herald of the morning, lightly
Tatyana asks: And instantly
To dream affection constantly
Though I've consulted frequently
In the past quite frequently
Ingenuous, trusting, earnestly
At his neighbour's grave, and truly
Her description here from any
Onegin, he was deemed by many
In that rural wilderness, Yevgeny
Swiftly apprising Yevgeny
But he's in error; our Yevgeny
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
So near! ...But now my destiny
If he had known what agony
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
Happy is he who can employ
I foresee all: how I'll annoy
Onegin shudders, turns, gives a cry
Once cold-blooded lechery
Was praised, all that debauchery
Until a fresh discovery
That one line in the memory
Lethe will drown all memory
Eugene, do you see in memory
My soul preserved its memory
How often, with some secret story
At the commencement of my story
All in good time, trust me, I'll try
Of over-elaborate slander try
Filled with terror, see her try
Bits of Northern poetry
The pleasures of the local gentry
Pampered in eastern luxury
Your spirit's true simplicity
Of placid dull rusticity
The ode shows pure nobility
That only mediocrity
So he'll double the intensity
Their greetings, ah, what a beauty
Hour by hour, by Olga's beauty
Buyanov, my lively 'cousin' leadz
